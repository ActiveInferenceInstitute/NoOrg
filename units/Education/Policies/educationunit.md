# Education Unit

## Overview
The Education unit is responsible for fostering a culture of continuous learning and development throughout the organization. It designs, delivers, and manages learning programs and resources to enhance employee skills, knowledge, and performance, aligning with organizational goals and promoting professional growth. This includes needs assessment, instructional design, content development, delivery management via various modalities (ILT, VILT, e-learning), technology administration (LMS), program evaluation, and vendor management.

## Core Responsibilities
- Conducting comprehensive **learning needs analysis (LNA)** across departments and roles to identify skill gaps and development opportunities.
- Designing and developing engaging and effective **curriculum, training materials, and learning content** (e-learning, instructor-led, blended learning, job aids, etc.).
- Delivering and facilitating high-impact **training sessions and workshops** (both in-person and virtual).
- Managing and administering the **Learning Management System (LMS)** and other learning technologies to ensure smooth delivery, tracking, and reporting.
- Developing and managing **career development pathways and programs** in collaboration with HR.
- Systematically **evaluating the effectiveness** of training programs and initiatives using established models (e.g., Kirkpatrick).
- Promoting **knowledge sharing** and fostering a community of practice around learning and development.
- Managing relationships with **external training vendors and institutions** to supplement internal capabilities.
- Supporting **onboarding programs** with relevant training modules for new hires.

## Key Processes
The core process typically follows a cycle from identifying needs to evaluating impact.
