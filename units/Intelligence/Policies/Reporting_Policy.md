# Intelligence Unit Reporting Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes standards and procedures for the creation, formatting, classification, and dissemination of intelligence reports and products generated by the Intelligence Unit. The goal is to ensure clarity, consistency, accuracy, timeliness, and appropriate handling of intelligence reporting.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all formal intelligence reports, briefs, assessments, alerts, and other analytical products created by the Intelligence Unit for internal or external stakeholders.

## 3. Reporting Principles

- **Accuracy:** Reports must be based on vetted information and clearly distinguish between facts, analysis, and speculation.
- **Objectivity:** Analysis and reporting must be unbiased and avoid policy advocacy.
- **Relevance:** Reports should be tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the intended audience ('Need-to-Know').
- **Timeliness:** Intelligence should be reported promptly, especially time-sensitive information like warnings or alerts.
- **Clarity & Conciseness:** Reports should be written clearly and concisely, avoiding jargon where possible. Key judgments and bottom-line assessments should be prominent (e.g., BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front).
- **Actionability:** Where applicable, reports should highlight implications and potential actions for the recipient.
- **Proper Classification & Handling:** All reports must be marked and handled according to their data classification level (see [[Data_Handling_Policy.md]]).

## 4. Report Types & Templates

The Intelligence Unit produces various report types. Standard templates should be used to ensure consistency. See [[../Reports/Report_Templates.md]] for specific formats. Common types include:
- **Intelligence Brief (Daily/Weekly):** Summary of key developments.
- **Threat Advisory/Alert:** Urgent notification of a specific, credible threat.
- **Competitor Profile:** In-depth analysis of a specific competitor.
- **Market Assessment:** Analysis of market trends, size, and dynamics.
- **Technology Landscape Report:** Overview of key technological developments.
- **Deep Dive Analysis:** Comprehensive study on a specific topic or intelligence question.

## 5. Content Standards

Standard reports should generally include:
- **Title:** Clear and descriptive title.
- **Classification Marking:** Prominently displayed (e.g., CONFIDENTIAL, INTERNAL USE ONLY).
- **Date of Publication & Reporting Period:** Clearly indicated.
- **Author/Unit:** Identifies the source.
- **Distribution List/Restrictions:** Specifies intended audience and any handling caveats.
- **Executive Summary / BLUF:** Concise overview of key findings and assessments.
- **Key Judgments:** The most critical analytical conclusions.
- **Analysis/Body:** Detailed information, supporting evidence, and analytical reasoning.
- **Source Summary/Confidence Levels:** Assessment of source reliability and confidence in analytical judgments (e.g., High/Medium/Low Confidence).
- **Outlook/Implications:** Potential future developments and impact on the organization.
- **Intelligence Gaps:** Areas where information is lacking.

## 6. Review & Approval Process

- **Peer Review:** Analytical products should undergo peer review for accuracy, logic, and clarity before finalization, especially for significant assessments.
- **Supervisory Review:** Reports typically require review and approval by the Head of Intelligence or a designated lead analyst before dissemination.
- **Legal/Compliance Review:** Reports with significant legal or regulatory implications may require review by the Legal or Compliance departments.

## 7. Dissemination Procedures

- **Authorized Channels:** Use only approved secure channels for dissemination (e.g., encrypted email, secure portals).
- **Audience Targeting:** Ensure reports are distributed only to individuals or groups with a validated need-to-know.
- **Tracking:** Maintain logs of disseminated reports (what was sent, to whom, when).

## 8. Feedback Mechanism

Establish a process for receiving feedback from intelligence consumers to assess the relevance, timeliness, and utility of reports and to identify areas for improvement.

## 9. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
