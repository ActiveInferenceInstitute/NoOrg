# Intelligence Unit Data Handling Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the procedures and standards for the collection, storage, processing, analysis, retention, and disposal of data and information used for intelligence purposes. It aims to ensure data integrity, security, confidentiality, and compliance with relevant regulations and organizational standards.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all personnel within the Intelligence Unit and covers all data acquired, processed, or generated during intelligence activities, regardless of format (digital, physical) or source.

## 3. Data Classification

Data handled by the Intelligence Unit should be classified according to the organization's overarching Data Classification Policy. Common classifications relevant to intelligence might include:
- **Public:** Information freely available in the public domain.
- **Internal:** Information intended for internal use only.
- **Confidential:** Sensitive information requiring strict access controls (e.g., specific competitive analyses, source identities).
- **Restricted:** Highly sensitive information with potential for significant damage if disclosed (e.g., critical vulnerability data, highly sensitive human source information).

*Intelligence personnel must be trained on appropriate handling procedures for each classification level.*

## 4. Collection & Acquisition

- **Legality & Ethics:** Data collection must adhere strictly to legal requirements and the [[Ethical_Guidelines.md]].
- **Source Vetting:** Sources of information should be vetted for reliability and bias where possible. Source characteristics should be documented.
- **Minimization:** Collect only the data necessary for the defined intelligence requirement.
- **Documentation:** Maintain records of data sources, collection methods, and timestamps.

## 5. Storage & Security

- **Approved Systems:** Data must be stored only on approved, secure organizational systems and platforms.
- **Access Control:** Access to intelligence data must be restricted based on the principle of least privilege and role-based access controls (RBAC).
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, following organizational encryption standards.
- **Physical Security:** Physical documents containing sensitive intelligence must be stored securely (e.g., locked cabinets, secure facilities).

## 6. Processing & Analysis

- **Integrity:** Procedures should be in place to ensure data accuracy and integrity during processing and analysis.
- **Tools:** Use only approved software and tools for analysis.
- **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Where appropriate and feasible, sensitive personal data should be anonymized or pseudonymized during analysis.

## 7. Dissemination & Sharing

- **Authorization:** Intelligence products should only be shared with authorized stakeholders based on their 'need-to-know'.
- **Secure Channels:** Use approved secure communication channels for disseminating sensitive intelligence.
- **Markings:** Intelligence products must be clearly marked with the appropriate data classification level and any handling caveats (e.g., "For Internal Use Only", "Confidential - Limited Distribution").

## 8. Retention & Disposal

- **Retention Schedule:** Adhere to the organization's data retention schedule. Intelligence data should not be kept longer than necessary for its purpose.
- **Secure Disposal:** Data must be disposed of securely according to organizational procedures (e.g., secure wiping for digital data, shredding for physical documents).

## 9. Compliance & Auditing

- **Training:** All Intelligence Unit personnel must receive regular training on this policy.
- **Monitoring:** Compliance with this policy may be subject to periodic audits.
- **Reporting Violations:** Personnel must report any suspected policy violations or data breaches immediately through designated channels.

## 10. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
