# Intelligence Unit Ethical Guidelines

## 1. Purpose

These guidelines establish the ethical principles and standards that govern all intelligence activities conducted by the Intelligence Unit. They are intended to ensure that intelligence operations are conducted with integrity, legality, and respect for individual rights and organizational values.

## 2. Scope

These guidelines apply to all personnel involved in intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination, regardless of their specific role or the nature of the intelligence being handled. They supplement, but do not replace, the organization's overarching Code of Conduct and relevant legal/regulatory requirements.

## 3. Core Principles

- **Legality:** All intelligence activities must comply with applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.
- **Honesty & Integrity:** Personnel must act honestly and ethically in all dealings. Misrepresentation, deception (beyond legally permissible and ethically sanctioned collection techniques), and fabrication of information are prohibited.
- **Objectivity & Neutrality:** Intelligence analysis must be objective, unbiased, and based on available evidence. Personal beliefs, political views, or policy preferences should not distort analysis or reporting.
- **Confidentiality:** Protect classified information, sensitive sources, and methods according to the [[Data_Handling_Policy.md]] and organizational security protocols.
- **Respect:** Treat all individuals, including competitors and subjects of intelligence gathering, with respect. Avoid harassment, discrimination, and invasion of privacy beyond what is legally permissible and operationally necessary.
- **Proportionality:** Intelligence collection methods should be proportionate to the importance of the intelligence requirement. Intrusive methods should only be used when necessary and legally justified.
- **Accountability:** Personnel are accountable for their actions and must adhere to these guidelines and related policies.

## 4. Specific Guidelines

- **Information Sources:**
    - Prioritize open and publicly available sources whenever possible.
    - Clearly distinguish between fact, opinion, and speculation in reporting.
    - Do not knowingly use or disseminate false or misleading information.
    - Respect intellectual property rights and copyright laws.
- **Collection Methods:**
    - Do not engage in illegal activities such as theft, bribery, hacking (unless explicitly authorized under strict legal/ethical frameworks for specific security roles, if applicable), or industrial espionage.
    - Be truthful about your identity and affiliation unless operating under legally sanctioned and ethically approved undercover protocols.
    - Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived.
- **Human Intelligence (HUMINT):**
    - Exercise extreme caution and adhere to strict protocols when dealing with human sources.
    - Do not coerce or improperly induce individuals to provide information.
    - Protect the identity and safety of confidential sources.
- **Data Privacy:**
    - Comply with all applicable data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when handling personal information.
    - Minimize the collection and retention of personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Reporting & Analysis:**
    - Ensure intelligence products are accurate, timely, and relevant.
    - Clearly state assumptions, uncertainties, and confidence levels in analysis.
    - Avoid sensationalism or bias in reporting.

## 5. Ethical Decision-Making Framework

When faced with an ethical dilemma, personnel should consider:
1.  **Legality:** Is the proposed action legal?
2.  **Policy Compliance:** Does it comply with organizational policies and these guidelines?
3.  **Values:** Does it align with organizational values and personal integrity?
4.  **Consequences:** What are the potential consequences for the organization, stakeholders, and individuals involved?
5.  **Transparency:** Would I be comfortable if this action were made public?

*If unsure, personnel must seek guidance from their supervisor, the Legal department, or the Ethics/Compliance office.*

## 6. Training & Awareness

All Intelligence Unit personnel will receive mandatory training on these ethical guidelines upon onboarding and periodically thereafter.

## 7. Reporting Concerns

Personnel are encouraged and expected to report any suspected ethical violations or concerns through established channels (e.g., supervisor, ethics hotline, Compliance department) without fear of retaliation.

## 8. Review

These guidelines will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
