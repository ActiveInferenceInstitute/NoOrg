# Intelligence Cycle Process

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the standard Intelligence Cycle model adopted by the Intelligence Unit. This cyclical process provides a structured framework for transforming raw information into actionable intelligence to meet stakeholder needs.

## 2. The Intelligence Cycle Model

The Intelligence Cycle consists of distinct but interconnected phases. While presented sequentially, the process is often iterative, with feedback influencing earlier stages.

## 3. Phase Descriptions

### 3.1. Planning & Direction
- **Objective:** Define intelligence requirements based on stakeholder needs and organizational priorities. Develop a collection plan.
- **Activities:**
    - Identify Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs).
    - Prioritize requirements.
    - Identify potential sources and collection methods.
    - Task collection assets/teams.
    - Establish reporting timelines and formats.
- **Inputs:** Stakeholder requests, strategic priorities, existing intelligence gaps, feedback from previous cycles.
- **Outputs:** Prioritized Intelligence Requirements (PIRs), Collection Plan.

### 3.2. Collection
- **Objective:** Gather raw information from various sources according to the Collection Plan.
- **Activities:**
    - Execute collection tasks (e.g., OSINT searches, database queries, attending events, liaising with internal SMEs).
    - Source vetting and validation (initial assessment).
    - Documenting collected information (metadata, source, timestamp).
- **Inputs:** Collection Plan, tasking orders.
- **Outputs:** Raw information/data.

### 3.3. Processing & Exploitation
- **Objective:** Convert collected raw information into a form suitable for analysis.
- **Activities:**
    - Data cleansing and normalization.
    - Translation (if necessary).
    - Data aggregation and organization.
    - Decryption or decoding (if applicable).
    - Initial sorting and filtering for relevance.
- **Inputs:** Raw information/data.
- **Outputs:** Processed information ready for analysis.

### 3.4. Analysis & Production
- **Objective:** Interpret processed information to identify patterns, insights, and implications. Create finished intelligence products.
- **Activities:**
    - Applying analytical techniques (e.g., SWOT, PESTLE, link analysis, statistical analysis).
    - Hypothesis testing.
    - Synthesizing information from multiple sources.
    - Evaluating source reliability and information credibility.
    - Developing assessments, judgments, and forecasts.
    - Drafting intelligence reports/briefs according to the [[../Policies/Reporting_Policy.md]].
- **Inputs:** Processed information.
- **Outputs:** Finished Intelligence Products (reports, briefs, alerts).

### 3.5. Dissemination & Integration
- **Objective:** Deliver finished intelligence products to the appropriate stakeholders in a timely and secure manner so they can act upon it.
- **Activities:**
    - Formatting reports for specific audiences.
    - Transmitting reports via secure channels.
    - Briefing stakeholders directly.
    - Integrating intelligence into relevant business processes and decision-making forums.
- **Inputs:** Finished Intelligence Products, stakeholder list, dissemination plan.
- **Outputs:** Intelligence consumed by stakeholders, potential actions/decisions.

### 3.6. Feedback
- **Objective:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the intelligence provided and the overall cycle performance.
- **Activities:**
    - Soliciting feedback from intelligence consumers.
    - Assessing if intelligence requirements were met.
    - Identifying process bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
    - Reviewing lessons learned.
- **Inputs:** Stakeholder feedback, performance metrics, self-assessment.
- **Outputs:** Recommendations for improving future Planning & Direction, collection, analysis, or dissemination.
