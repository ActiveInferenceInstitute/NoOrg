# Threat Assessment Process

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the process used by the Intelligence Unit to systematically identify, assess, and report on potential threats to the organization. This includes threats related to competitors, market shifts, technology disruptions, geopolitical events, security vulnerabilities, and other relevant areas.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to the ongoing monitoring and reactive assessment of threats identified through the [[Intelligence_Cycle.md]].

## 3. Process Overview

The threat assessment process involves several key steps:

## 4. Step Descriptions

### 4.1. Threat Identification
- **Objective:** Detect potential threats from various sources.
- **Activities:**
    - Continuous monitoring of predefined indicators and warnings (I&W).
    - Analysis of open-source intelligence (OSINT), news feeds, industry reports.
    - Review of internal data (e.g., security logs, operational reports).
    - Processing alerts from subscription services.
    - Receiving ad-hoc reports from internal stakeholders or external partners.
    - Initial filtering based on relevance and plausibility.
- **Inputs:** Raw data, alerts, stakeholder reports, I&W list.
- **Outputs:** Potential Threat Indicator (PTI).

### 4.2. Information Gathering
- **Objective:** Collect detailed information about the identified Potential Threat Indicator (PTI).
- **Activities:**
    - Focused collection efforts targeting the specific PTI (leveraging [[Intelligence_Cycle.md]] Phase 2).
    - Seeking corroborating evidence from multiple sources.
    - Gathering context about the threat actor (if applicable), mechanism, potential targets, and timeline.
- **Inputs:** PTI, Collection Plan.
- **Outputs:** Collated information package on the potential threat.

### 4.3. Threat Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze the gathered information to understand the nature, capabilities, intent (if applicable), and potential evolution of the threat.
- **Activities:**
    - Characterize the threat (e.g., competitor action, market disruption, cyber attack vector).
    - Assess the credibility and reliability of the information.
    - Analyze the threat actor's capabilities and intent (where relevant).
    - Identify potential organizational vulnerabilities targeted by the threat.
    - Develop potential scenarios for how the threat might manifest or evolve.
- **Inputs:** Collated information package.
- **Outputs:** Analyzed Threat Profile.

### 4.4. Risk Assessment
- **Objective:** Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of the analyzed threat to determine the level of risk to the organization.
- **Activities:**
    - Assess the potential impact (e.g., financial, operational, reputational, strategic) using a defined scale (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).
    - Assess the likelihood of the threat occurring within a specific timeframe (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
    - Combine impact and likelihood assessments to determine an overall risk level (often using a risk matrix).
    - Consider existing controls or mitigation factors.
- **Inputs:** Analyzed Threat Profile, Organizational Context, Risk Matrix/Framework.
- **Outputs:** Threat Risk Level, Prioritized Threat List.

### 4.5. Reporting & Recommendations
- **Objective:** Communicate the assessed threat and associated risk level to relevant stakeholders, providing actionable recommendations where appropriate.
- **Activities:**
    - Prepare Threat Advisory, Alert, or Assessment report according to [[../Policies/Reporting_Policy.md]].
    - Clearly articulate the threat, the assessed risk level, the basis for the assessment, and potential implications.
    - Recommend mitigation strategies, further monitoring actions, or contingency planning steps (in coordination with relevant units like Risk Management or Security).
    - Disseminate the report to authorized stakeholders based on urgency and classification.
- **Inputs:** Threat Risk Level, Analyzed Threat Profile.
- **Outputs:** Threat Report/Alert, Recommendations.

### 4.6. Monitoring & Review
- **Objective:** Continuously monitor the status of identified threats and review the effectiveness of the assessment process.
- **Activities:**
    - Track the evolution of reported threats.
    - Monitor the effectiveness of implemented mitigation measures.
    - Update threat assessments as new information becomes available.
    - Periodically review and update the I&W list and assessment methodologies.
    - Gather feedback on threat reporting.
- **Inputs:** Threat Reports, New Information, Feedback.
- **Outputs:** Updated Threat Assessments, Process Improvement Recommendations.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Intelligence Analysts:** Responsible for executing steps 1-5.
- **Head of Intelligence:** Oversees the process, reviews critical assessments, ensures appropriate dissemination.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide input, receive reports, and potentially act on recommendations (e.g., Risk Management, Security, Strategy, Executive Leadership).
