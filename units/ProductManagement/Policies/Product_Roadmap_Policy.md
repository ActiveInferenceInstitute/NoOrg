# Product Roadmap Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** {{Current Date}}
**Policy Owner:** Head of Product
**Applies To:** All members of the Product Management, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and relevant stakeholder teams.

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the principles, processes, and responsibilities governing the creation, maintenance, communication, and modification of the product roadmap. The goal is to ensure the roadmap is a strategic, transparent, and reliable tool that aligns product development efforts with company objectives, market opportunities, and customer needs.

## 2. Policy Statement

The organization will maintain a clear, prioritized, and up-to-date product roadmap accessible to relevant stakeholders. The roadmap serves as the authoritative source for planned product initiatives, features, and timelines (where applicable). All significant product development work must align with the approved roadmap.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all products and services managed by the Product Management unit. It covers the entire lifecycle of roadmap items, from initial ideation and proposal through prioritization, inclusion, development tracking, and eventual release or removal.

## 4. Principles

* **Strategic Alignment:** The roadmap must directly support the overall company strategy, product vision, and business goals outlined in the [[../Charter.md|Product Management Charter]].
* **Customer Focus:** Roadmap priorities should be heavily influenced by validated customer needs, feedback, and market research.
* **Value-Driven:** Prioritization decisions will be based on maximizing value delivery (e.g., strategic importance, customer value, revenue impact, cost savings) relative to effort.
* **Transparency:** The roadmap (or relevant views thereof) will be shared proactively and regularly with key stakeholders to foster alignment and manage expectations. Confidentiality requirements must be respected.
* **Adaptability:** The roadmap is a living document and must be flexible enough to adapt to changing market conditions, customer feedback, competitive pressures, and strategic pivots. However, changes must follow the defined process.
* **Feasibility:** Roadmap items should be assessed for technical and resource feasibility in collaboration with Engineering and other relevant teams.
* **Data-Informed:** Decisions regarding roadmap inclusion and prioritization should be supported by data (market analysis, user research, performance metrics, business cases) whenever possible.

## 5. Roadmap Structure & Content

The official product roadmap will typically include (but may vary based on audience and context):

* **Themes/Strategic Goals:** High-level objectives the roadmap items contribute to.
* **Initiatives/Epics:** Major pieces of work or significant features.
* **Timeline Horizon:** Generally categorized into timeframes (e.g., Now, Next, Later; or Quarterly) rather than specific delivery dates, especially for longer-term items, to allow for flexibility. Development teams may maintain more granular, date-driven release plans.
* **Prioritization:** Clear indication of priority for items within a given timeframe.
* **Status:** High-level status (e.g., Discovery, Definition, In Development, Launched, On Hold).
* **Problem/Opportunity:** Brief description of the customer or business problem being solved.
* **Key Metrics:** How success will be measured (where applicable).

## 6. Process & Responsibilities

* **Input Gathering:** Product Managers are responsible for continuously gathering roadmap inputs from various sources (stakeholder requests, customer feedback, market analysis, strategic directives, internal ideas). See [[../Processes/User_Feedback_Collection_Process.md]].
* **Proposal & Validation:** Ideas are fleshed out, validated (market/customer research, technical feasibility), and potentially documented in a business case or opportunity assessment. See [[../Processes/Product_Discovery_Process.md]].
* **Prioritization:** Proposed items are evaluated and prioritized using a defined framework (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW, Value vs. Effort). See [[../Processes/Roadmap_Prioritization_Process.md]]. Prioritization occurs regularly (e.g., quarterly).
* **Roadmap Planning & Approval:** The Product Management unit, led by the Head of Product, compiles the draft roadmap. It is reviewed and approved by the Product Steering Committee at defined intervals (e.g., quarterly).
* **Communication:** Approved roadmaps (and significant updates) are communicated to relevant stakeholders through designated channels (e.g., dedicated meetings, internal wiki, roadmap software).
* **Maintenance:** Product Managers are responsible for keeping the roadmap tool updated with the latest status and priorities for their respective product areas.
* **Change Management:** Significant changes to the approved roadmap (e.g., adding/removing major initiatives, significant scope changes, major priority shifts) outside of the regular planning cycle require justification and re-approval through [Defined Change Control Process/Approval Body]. Minor adjustments within an initiative's scope are typically managed by the Product Manager in consultation with the development team.

## 7. Roadmap Tooling

The official product roadmap will be maintained in [Specify Tool, e.g., Jira Align, Aha!, Productboard, specific internal tool/document format].

## 8. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Head of Product and Chief Product Officer.

## 9. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually by the Head of Product and updated as necessary.
