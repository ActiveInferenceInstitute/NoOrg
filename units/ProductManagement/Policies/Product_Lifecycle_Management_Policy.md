# Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** {{Current Date}}
**Policy Owner:** Head of Product
**Applies To:** All teams involved in the product lifecycle, including Product Management, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, Operations, Finance, and Legal.

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the framework and stages for managing products throughout their entire lifecycle, from conception and development through launch, growth, maturity, and eventual end-of-life (EOL). The goal is to ensure consistent, strategic, and cross-functional management of products to maximize value, optimize resource allocation, and minimize risks.

## 2. Policy Statement

All products managed by the Product Management unit will adhere to a defined lifecycle management process. Each product will be actively managed according to its current lifecycle stage, with specific criteria, activities, and reviews governing transitions between stages.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all commercial products and services offered by the organization.

## 4. Product Lifecycle Stages

The standard product lifecycle stages are defined as follows:

*   **Stage 0: Conception/Ideation:** Initial idea generation, market research, opportunity assessment, concept validation. Key activities include market analysis, user research, competitive analysis, initial feasibility studies, and business case development.
    *   *Exit Criteria:* Approved business case, initial high-level requirements, executive sponsorship.
*   **Stage 1: Development:** Detailed planning, design, engineering, prototyping, and testing of the product. Key activities include defining detailed requirements (PRD/backlog), UX/UI design, architecture definition, coding, quality assurance testing, and documentation development.
    *   *Exit Criteria:* Feature complete product meeting quality standards, alpha/beta testing completed, initial launch plan drafted, required documentation ready.
*   **Stage 2: Launch:** Introduction of the product to the market. Key activities include finalizing go-to-market strategy, executing marketing and sales plans, final testing, deployment, sales and support team training, and initial performance monitoring.
    *   *Exit Criteria:* Product successfully deployed and available to target customers, launch communications executed, early performance metrics tracked.
*   **Stage 3: Growth:** Focus on increasing market adoption, user base, and revenue. Key activities include scaling infrastructure, optimizing performance, iterating on features based on feedback, expanding marketing efforts, and refining sales strategies.
    *   *Exit Criteria:* Product achieves significant market traction, growth rate potentially starts to slow, focus shifts towards profitability and competitive differentiation.
*   **Stage 4: Maturity:** Product is well-established, market share is stable or declining slowly, focus shifts to maximizing profit and defending market position. Key activities include optimizing operational efficiency, managing costs, exploring minor enhancements or variations, potentially extending into new segments, and defending against competition.
    *   *Exit Criteria:* Declining growth, profitability, or strategic relevance; consideration for end-of-life planning begins.
*   **Stage 5: End-of-Life (EOL) / Decline:** Product is phased out of the market. Key activities include developing an EOL plan, communicating timelines to customers and internal teams, planning migration paths (if applicable), managing final support, and eventual retirement of the product.
    *   *Exit Criteria:* Product is fully retired, support is terminated according to plan, customers migrated (if applicable).

## 5. Governance & Stage-Gate Reviews

Transitions between key lifecycle stages (e.g., Conception to Development, Development to Launch, Maturity to EOL) will be governed by formal Stage-Gate reviews.

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the product's progress, performance, market fit, and strategic alignment before committing further resources.
*   **Attendees:** Reviews will typically involve key stakeholders from Product Management, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Executive Leadership.
*   **Criteria:** Each review will have predefined criteria based on the specific stage transition, covering aspects like market validation, technical feasibility, financial viability, GTM readiness, performance metrics, and EOL impact.
*   **Decisions:** Outcomes of a Stage-Gate review can include Go (proceed to next stage), No-Go (stop development/retire), Hold (pause for further review/information), or Recycle (revisit current stage with modifications).
*   **Responsibility:** Product Management is responsible for preparing and presenting the necessary information for Stage-Gate reviews. The [Relevant Committee/Executive Body TBD, e.g., Product Steering Committee] is typically the decision-making body.

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities

*   **Product Management:** Owns the product strategy throughout the lifecycle, defines stage criteria, leads Stage-Gate review preparation, coordinates cross-functional activities, and makes recommendations for stage transitions.
*   **Engineering:** Responsible for technical development, feasibility assessments, quality, and supporting deployment and maintenance according to the lifecycle stage.
*   **Marketing:** Develops and executes go-to-market strategies, manages product positioning and messaging, and drives demand generation appropriate to the lifecycle stage.
*   **Sales:** Executes sales strategies, provides market feedback, and manages customer relationships relevant to the product's stage.
*   **Support/Success:** Provides customer assistance, gathers feedback, and manages support levels according to the EOL plan during the decline stage.
*   **Finance:** Provides financial analysis, tracks profitability, and assists in business case development and budget allocation.
*   **Legal:** Ensures compliance and manages contractual aspects throughout the lifecycle.

## 7. End-of-Life (EOL) Planning

A formal EOL plan must be developed when a product enters the decline stage or a decision is made to retire it. The plan must address:

*   **Rationale:** Clear reasons for the EOL decision.
*   **Timelines:** Key dates for announcement, end-of-sale, end-of-support, and final retirement.
*   **Customer Communication:** Strategy and schedule for notifying customers.
*   **Migration Strategy:** Plans for migrating customers to alternative products (if applicable).
*   **Support Plan:** Details on the level and duration of remaining support.
*   **Internal Communication:** Plan for informing internal teams (Sales, Support, Marketing, etc.).
*   **Data Archival/Disposal:** Procedures for handling product data.
*   **Financial Implications:** Assessment of revenue impact and potential cost savings.

EOL plans require approval from [Relevant Committee/Executive Body TBD].

## 8. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy require documented justification and approval from the Head of Product and [Executive Sponsor TBD].

## 9. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually by the Head of Product and updated as necessary.
