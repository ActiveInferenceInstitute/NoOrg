## Detailed Process Steps

### 1. Identify Retirement Candidates

**Description:** Systematic identification of knowledge assets that may be candidates for retirement.

**Activities:**
- Run automated reports to identify assets meeting retirement criteria
- Review asset usage statistics and access logs
- Consider feedback from users and content owners

- Results from [[KnowledgeReviewProcess|Knowledge Review Process]]
- User feedback mechanisms
- Content owner notifications
- Superseded asset alerts

**Retirement Triggers:**
- Age beyond retention period
- Low usage statistics
- Poor quality ratings
- Superseded by newer content
- Business process/product discontinuation
- Organizational changes
- Regulatory/compliance changes
