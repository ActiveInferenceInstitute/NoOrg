## Detailed Process Steps

### 1. Identify Knowledge to Share

**Description:** Identification of valuable knowledge that should be shared across the organization.

**Activities:**
- Review knowledge inventories and repositories
- Analyze knowledge gap assessments
- Identify critical expertise and best practices
- Consider lessons learned from projects and initiatives
- Evaluate external knowledge that should be internalized
- Recognize tacit knowledge that should be made explicit

**Knowledge Types:**
- Technical expertise and skills
- Process knowledge
- Project experiences and lessons learned
- Best practices and methodologies
- Industry and market insights
- Customer knowledge
- Product/service knowledge
- Organizational knowledge

**Outputs:**
- Prioritized list of knowledge to be shared
- Initial value assessment
- Knowledge owner identification

- [[BestPracticeIdentificationProcess|Best Practice Identification Process]]

### 2. Assess Sharing Requirements

**Description:** Evaluation of the specific requirements for effectively sharing the identified knowledge.

**Activities:**
- Determine knowledge complexity and structure
- Assess level of tacit vs. explicit components
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Consider audience characteristics and needs
- Evaluate sensitivity and confidentiality requirements
- Determine urgency and timing considerations

**Assessment Dimensions:**
- Complexity (simple to complex)
- Structure (well-structured to unstructured)
- Type (procedural, conceptual, contextual)
- Sensitivity (public to confidential)
- Scope (narrow to broad application)
- Stability (stable to rapidly changing)

**Outputs:**
- Knowledge sharing requirements profile
- Sensitivity and classification designation

**Reference:**
- [[../Policies/DataClassificationPolicy|Data Classification Policy]]

### 3. Select Sharing Approach

**Description:** Choosing the most appropriate method(s) for sharing the knowledge based on its characteristics and requirements.

**Activities:**

- Consider resource constraints and availability

**Sharing Approaches:**
- Documentation (procedures, guides, manuals)
- Training (formal, informal, on-the-job)
- Mentoring and coaching
- Communities of practice
- Knowledge-sharing sessions
- Storytelling and case studies
- Expert directories and networks
- Collaborative platforms and tools
- Job rotation and shadowing
- After-action reviews and debriefs

**Outputs:**
- Selected sharing approach(es)
- Approach rationale
- Initial implementation plan

### 4. Prepare Knowledge Assets

**Description:** Development and packaging of knowledge into appropriate formats for effective sharing.

**Activities:**
- Extract knowledge from source (explicit or tacit)

- Obtain necessary approvals

**Asset Formats:**
- Documents and guides
- Presentations and slide decks
- Videos and multimedia
- Interactive learning modules
- Templates and checklists
- Process diagrams and maps
- Case studies and examples
- FAQs and knowledge base articles
- Decision support tools

**Outputs:**
- Knowledge assets ready for sharing
- Associated metadata and categorization
- Quality assurance documentation
