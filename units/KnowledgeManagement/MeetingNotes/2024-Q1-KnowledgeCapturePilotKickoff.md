## Discussion Points

### 1. Project Overview

Sarah presented the Knowledge Capture Pilot project objectives:
- Test the newly developed [[../Processes/KnowledgeCaptureProcess|Knowledge Capture Process]] in two departments
- Capture critical expertise from identified SMEs in Product Development and R&D
- Develop a repeatable methodology for broader organizational deployment
- Establish baseline metrics for future knowledge capture initiatives

The pilot aligns with Strategic Initiative 4 ([[../StrategicPlan|Strategic Plan]]) focusing on Critical Knowledge Preservation.

### 2. Pilot Scope

**Selected knowledge domains for the pilot:**
- Product design validation methodologies (Product Development)
- Advanced research protocols for emerging technologies (R&D)

**Key activities:**
- SME interviews and knowledge elicitation (4 weeks)
- Documentation and knowledge asset creation (3 weeks)
- Validation and refinement (2 weeks)
- Initial application and feedback (3 weeks)

**Deliverables:**
- Structured knowledge assets in the designated knowledge repository
- Documented methodology refinements
- Metrics on capture efficiency and knowledge quality
- Lessons learned and recommendations for scaling

### 3. Methodology Discussion

Michael presented the knowledge elicitation techniques that will be used:
- Structured interviews
- Process mapping
- Decision tree analysis
- Critical incident technique
- Scenario-based questioning

Discussion points:
- Emma suggested adding concept mapping for the research protocols
- David requested more emphasis on visual documentation for design methodologies
- Robert emphasized the need for quality checks throughout the process
- Agreement to use a mix of techniques based on the knowledge type
