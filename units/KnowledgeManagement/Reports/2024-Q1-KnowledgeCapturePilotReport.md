# Knowledge Capture Pilot Initiative Report - Q1 2024

**Report Date:** March 31, 2024  
**Project Period:** January 15 - March 30, 2024  
**Prepared By:** Sarah Chen, Knowledge Management Lead  
**Distribution:** Knowledge Management Steering Committee, Executive Committee, Pilot Participants  

## Executive Summary

The Knowledge Capture Pilot initiative was successfully completed in Q1 2024, testing the newly developed [[../Processes/KnowledgeCaptureProcess|Knowledge Capture Process]] in the Product Development and R&D departments. The pilot demonstrated significant value, capturing critical expertise from subject matter experts and creating reusable knowledge assets. Key metrics show high knowledge quality ratings (4.7/5) and strong user satisfaction (4.5/5), with estimated time savings of 28 hours per month for target users. The methodology performed well overall with several identified improvement opportunities. We recommend organization-wide rollout with refinements as detailed in this report.

## Background

This pilot initiative was launched in alignment with Strategic Initiative 4 ([[../StrategicPlan|Strategic Plan]]) focusing on Critical Knowledge Preservation. The initiative aimed to:

1. Test the newly developed Knowledge Capture Process methodology
2. Capture critical expertise from identified SMEs in Product Development and R&D
3. Develop a repeatable methodology for broader organizational deployment
4. Establish baseline metrics for future knowledge capture initiatives

The pilot was formally kicked off on January 15, 2024, with a [[../MeetingNotes/2024-Q1-KnowledgeCapturePilotKickoff|formal kickoff meeting]] and completed on March 30, 2024.

## Methodology

The Knowledge Capture Pilot applied the following methodology:

1. **Knowledge domain scoping**: Worked with department leaders to identify high-value knowledge domains
2. **SME identification and preparation**: Selected and briefed key subject matter experts
3. **Knowledge elicitation**: Conducted structured sessions using multiple techniques:
   - Structured interviews
   - Process mapping
   - Decision tree analysis
   - Critical incident technique
   - Concept mapping
   - Visual documentation
4. **Documentation and organization**: Created structured knowledge assets with appropriate metadata
5. **Validation and refinement**: Verified accuracy and completeness with SMEs and validators
6. **Application and feedback**: Tested with target users and gathered feedback
7. **Evaluation and reporting**: Measured effectiveness and documented lessons learned

## Results

### Knowledge Assets Created

**Product Development domain**:
- Design validation methodology knowledge map (interactive)
- 12 structured design validation processes with decision points
- Video demonstrations of 5 critical validation techniques
- Expert Q&A library with 47 frequently asked questions
- Troubleshooting decision tree for common validation issues
- Case study library with 8 examples of effective validation approaches

**R&D domain**:
- Research protocol standardized templates (7)
- Advanced research methodology guide with 28 sections
- Expert insights from 3 senior researchers (video and transcripts)
- Protocol selection decision framework
- Common pitfalls and mitigation strategies guide
- Emerging technology research roadmap with methodology implications

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Commentary |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Knowledge quality rating (1-5) | 4.0 | 4.7 | SMEs and validators rated content highly accurate and comprehensive |
| User satisfaction (1-5) | 4.0 | 4.5 | Target users report high value and usability |
| Knowledge capture efficiency | 5 hrs/asset | 6.2 hrs/asset | Slightly below target but acceptable for initial implementation |
| First-time usability (1-5) | 3.5 | 4.2 | Users found knowledge assets intuitive and immediately applicable |
| Knowledge comprehensiveness (1-5) | 4.0 | 4.6 | Few gaps identified in captured knowledge |
| Estimated monthly time savings | 20 hrs | 28 hrs | Based on user self-reporting of time saved in first month |
| Implementation cost | $25K | $23.7K | Under budget, primarily due to efficient scheduling |

### User Feedback Highlights

*"The design validation guide answered questions that would normally take days of tracking down the right people. It's already saved me at least 10 hours in the first few weeks of use."* - Product Design Engineer

*"Having the expert insights so accessible makes a tremendous difference, especially for newer team members. The video demonstrations are particularly valuable for understanding nuanced techniques."* - R&D Team Lead

*"The organized structure and thorough cross-referencing made it easy to find exactly what I needed when I was stuck on a validation issue."* - Product Testing Specialist

*"This is the knowledge resource I've needed for years. I've already referred three colleagues to specific sections that solved persistent challenges."* - Senior Researcher

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Mixed media approach**: Combining text, visuals, video, and interactive elements significantly enhanced knowledge transfer
2. **Structured elicitation techniques**: The combination of methods yielded more comprehensive knowledge than single-technique approaches
3. **Iterative validation**: Multiple review cycles with different stakeholders ensured quality and completeness
4. **Real-world scenarios**: Anchoring knowledge in actual cases improved relevance and applicability
5. **Repository organization**: The knowledge architecture with consistent metadata facilitated easy discovery

### Challenges and Improvement Opportunities

1. **SME time constraints**: Competing priorities occasionally delayed sessions; need better upfront time blocking
2. **Tacit knowledge extraction**: Some highly intuitive expertise remained difficult to articulate; need enhanced techniques
3. **Consistency across domains**: Different knowledge types required significantly different approaches; more domain-specific guidance needed
4. **Technical limitations**: Current repository has limitations for interactive content; technology enhancements needed
5. **Knowledge granularity**: Finding the right level of detail proved challenging; clearer guidelines needed

## Recommendations

Based on the pilot results, we recommend the following:

1. **Proceed with organization-wide implementation** of the Knowledge Capture Process with the following refinements:
   - Develop domain-specific elicitation templates
   - Enhance guidance on knowledge granularity
   - Strengthen the knowledge validation protocol
   - Improve SME scheduling and preparation guidance

2. **Technology enhancements** to better support knowledge capture and sharing:
   - Implement enhanced interactive content capabilities
   - Improve video integration and search
   - Add collaborative annotation features
   - Strengthen analytics for usage tracking

3. **Methodology refinements**:
   - Develop additional methods for tacit knowledge extraction
   - Create clearer guidance on knowledge asset types by domain
   - Enhance the knowledge structuring framework
   - Provide more examples and templates

4. **Implementation approach**:
   - Prioritize high-value knowledge domains using risk-based assessment
   - Phase implementation by department over next 12 months
   - Establish knowledge capture coordinator roles in each department
   - Develop train-the-trainer program for knowledge facilitators

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Capture Pilot has successfully validated our approach to capturing and sharing critical organizational knowledge. With a structured methodology, appropriate tools, and committed participation, we have demonstrated significant value in making expertise accessible and reusable. The lessons learned provide a clear path to refinement, and we recommend proceeding with organization-wide implementation following the proposed enhancements.

The pilot has created immediate value for the participating departments while establishing a foundation for systematic knowledge preservation across the organization. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, we can scale this initiative effectively to address critical knowledge risks and enhance organizational performance.
