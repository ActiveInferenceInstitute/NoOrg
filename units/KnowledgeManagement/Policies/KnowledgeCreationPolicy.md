# Knowledge Creation Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy outlines the principles, responsibilities, and standards for the creation of new knowledge assets within the organization. The goal is to ensure that newly generated knowledge is valuable, accurate, relevant, easily discoverable, and aligns with organizational objectives and knowledge management (KM) strategy.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:
- Promote the systematic creation and capture of valuable organizational knowledge (both explicit and tacit).
- Establish clear standards for the quality, format, and documentation of new knowledge assets.
- Define roles and responsibilities related to knowledge creation.
- Ensure that knowledge creation efforts are aligned with business needs and strategic priorities.
- Foster a culture where knowledge creation is recognized and valued.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and partners involved in creating knowledge assets intended for organizational use. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Project documentation (reports, plans, lessons learned)
- Research findings and analyses
- Best practices and standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Training materials and guides
- Technical documentation and specifications
- Meeting minutes with key decisions or insights
- "How-to" guides and FAQs
- Case studies and success stories
- Expert directories and profiles

## 4. Principles

Knowledge creation within the organization shall adhere to the following principles:
- **Relevance:** Knowledge created should address specific organizational needs, solve problems, or contribute to strategic goals.
- **Accuracy:** Information must be factually correct, validated, and reliable. Assumptions should be clearly stated.
- **Clarity:** Knowledge assets should be presented in a clear, concise, and understandable manner, suitable for the intended audience.
- **Completeness:** Assets should contain sufficient context, background, and detail to be useful without extensive external explanation.
- **Discoverability:** Knowledge must be created and tagged in a way that makes it easily findable through organizational search tools and knowledge repositories. Use standardized metadata and taxonomies.
- **Timeliness:** Knowledge should be captured and documented promptly to retain its value and context.
- **Attribution:** Authorship and sources should be clearly identified. Contributions from others should be acknowledged.
- **Security:** Knowledge assets must be classified according to the [Data Classification Policy](DataClassificationPolicy.md) and handled appropriately to protect sensitive information.
- **Originality:** Avoid duplication. Before creating new content, check existing repositories for relevant knowledge. If building upon existing work, cite it appropriately.

## 5. Responsibilities

- **All Employees:** Responsible for identifying opportunities to create valuable knowledge based on their work, experience, and expertise. Responsible for adhering to this policy when creating knowledge assets.
- **Managers/Team Leads:** Responsible for encouraging and enabling knowledge creation within their teams, ensuring alignment with team goals, and verifying the quality and relevance of created assets.
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** Responsible for validating the accuracy and completeness of knowledge assets within their domain of expertise. Expected to proactively contribute their specialized knowledge.
- **Project Managers:** Responsible for ensuring that knowledge generated during projects (e.g., lessons learned, documentation) is captured according to KM standards.
- **Knowledge Management (KM) Unit:** Responsible for developing and maintaining KM standards, providing tools and templates, offering training and support, overseeing the knowledge lifecycle, and promoting a knowledge creation culture.

## 6. Standards and Procedures

- **Templates:** Utilize official organizational templates where available for specific types of knowledge assets (e.g., project reports, SOPs, meeting minutes). Templates can be found [Link to Template Repository or KM Portal].
- **Metadata/Tagging:** Apply standardized metadata tags upon creation to categorize content, indicate ownership, specify keywords, and set review dates. Refer to the [Organizational Taxonomy/Metadata Standard Document].
- **Storage Location:** Store newly created knowledge assets in the designated official repositories (e.g., knowledge base, document management system, project sites) as defined by the KM Unit and relevant departmental guidelines. Avoid storing official knowledge solely on personal drives or local machines.
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow established file and document naming conventions for consistency and discoverability. Refer to [Link to Naming Convention Guidelines].
- **Review and Validation:** Critical knowledge assets, especially those defining procedures or best practices, must undergo review and validation by relevant SMEs or peers before publication. The specific review process may vary based on the asset type and criticality.
- **Explicit vs. Tacit Knowledge:** While this policy primarily focuses on explicit knowledge (documents, data), efforts should also be made to capture tacit knowledge (know-how, experience) through mechanisms like expert interviews, communities of practice, mentoring programs, and lessons learned sessions. Documented outputs from these activities fall under this policy.
- **Format:** Use standard, accessible file formats. Prefer formats that support search and indexing.

## 7. Tools and Technology

The organization provides specific tools and platforms for knowledge creation and storage (e.g., Wiki, SharePoint, Confluence, dedicated Knowledge Base software). Employees are expected to utilize these designated tools. The KM Unit provides guidance on the appropriate tool for different types of knowledge.

## 8. Training and Awareness

The KM Unit will provide training and resources on knowledge creation best practices, standards, and the use of relevant tools. Regular communication will reinforce the importance of knowledge creation.

## 9. Policy Compliance

Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Non-compliance may result in knowledge not being effectively leveraged, duplication of effort, and potential loss of valuable organizational insights. Repeated disregard for the policy may be addressed through standard performance management processes.

## 10. Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually by the KM Unit and updated as necessary to reflect changes in organizational needs, technology, or KM strategy. Feedback on this policy is welcomed and should be directed to the KM Unit.
