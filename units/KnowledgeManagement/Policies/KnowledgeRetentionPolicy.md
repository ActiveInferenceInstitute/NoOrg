# Knowledge Retention Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy defines the framework and procedures for the retention, archival, and disposition of organizational knowledge assets. It aims to ensure that valuable knowledge is retained for as long as it is useful, relevant, and required for business or compliance purposes, while obsolete, trivial, or redundant information is systematically removed.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:
- Establish clear guidelines for the lifecycle management of knowledge assets.
- Ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and organizational record-keeping requirements.
- Optimize the use of storage resources and improve the efficiency of knowledge retrieval by removing outdated content.
- Preserve critical organizational knowledge and intellectual property.
- Mitigate risks associated with retaining unnecessary data.
- Define roles and responsibilities for knowledge retention and disposition.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all official organizational knowledge assets, regardless of format or storage location, managed within the scope of the Knowledge Management (KM) program. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Documents stored in knowledge bases, document management systems, shared drives, and project repositories.
- Content within collaboration platforms designated as knowledge resources.
- Key outputs from Communities of Practice (CoPs).
- Formalized lessons learned and best practices.
- Training materials.
- Research data and reports (subject to specific research data management policies where applicable).

This policy does *not* typically apply to transient communications (e.g., routine emails, instant messages not containing substantial knowledge), personal notes, or data governed by separate, specific legal hold requirements (though a legal hold overrides this policy's disposition schedule).

## 4. Principles

Knowledge retention practices shall adhere to the following principles:
- **Value-Based Retention:** Retain knowledge based on its ongoing business value, historical significance, or legal/regulatory requirements.
- **Compliance:** Ensure retention schedules meet or exceed minimum requirements set by law, regulations, and industry standards.
- **Consistency:** Apply retention rules consistently across similar types of knowledge assets.
- **Accessibility (Archival):** Archived knowledge should remain accessible if needed for specific, infrequent lookups, though perhaps with longer retrieval times than active knowledge.
- **Defensible Disposition:** Have clear criteria and authorization processes for deleting knowledge assets.
- **Regular Review:** Periodically review knowledge assets to assess their continued relevance and accuracy, triggering retention, archival, or disposition actions.
- **Integration:** Align KM retention schedules with broader organizational records management and data governance policies.

## 5. Responsibilities

- **Knowledge Owners/Creators:** Responsible for applying appropriate metadata (including initial retention category if applicable) upon creation, participating in review cycles, and identifying knowledge that may be obsolete or ready for disposition.
- **Managers/Team Leads:** Responsible for overseeing the application of retention policies within their teams and ensuring compliance.
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** Responsible for reviewing knowledge assets within their domain for accuracy and continued relevance during review cycles.
- **Knowledge Management (KM) Unit:** Responsible for developing and maintaining the knowledge retention schedule, defining review processes, managing archival systems (where applicable), overseeing policy implementation, providing guidance, and coordinating with Legal and Compliance.
- **Legal/Compliance Department:** Responsible for providing guidance on legal and regulatory retention requirements and approving the retention schedule. Responsible for issuing legal hold directives.
- **IT Department:** Responsible for providing and maintaining the technical infrastructure for storing, archiving, and disposing of digital knowledge assets according to the defined policies and schedules.

## 6. Knowledge Retention Schedule

A detailed Knowledge Retention Schedule, maintained by the KM Unit and approved by Legal/Compliance, defines specific retention periods for different categories of knowledge assets. This schedule considers:
- **Asset Type:** (e.g., Project Report, SOP, Research Finding, Meeting Minutes)
- **Business Value:** (e.g., High Strategic Importance, Operational Reference, Historical Interest)
- **Regulatory/Legal Requirements:** (e.g., Financial Records, HR Records, Contractual Obligations)
- **Frequency of Use:** (How often is the asset accessed?)

The schedule will typically define:
- **Active Retention Period:** Duration the asset remains in active, easily accessible systems.
- **Review Trigger:** Event or time triggering a review (e.g., End of Project + 1 year, Annually).
- **Archival Period:** Duration the asset is kept in a less accessible archive (if applicable).
- **Final Disposition:** Action after the total retention period (e.g., Permanent Archive, Deletion).

## 7. Procedures

- **Classification:** Knowledge assets should be classified or tagged at creation (or as soon as feasible) to align with categories in the Retention Schedule.
- **Review Process:** The KM Unit will coordinate periodic reviews of knowledge assets based on triggers defined in the schedule. Owners and SMEs will assess relevance, accuracy, and need for retention, update, archival, or disposition.
- **Archival:** Assets designated for archival will be moved to a designated archive location. Metadata should be preserved to allow future discovery if needed.
- **Disposition:** Assets reaching the end of their retention period, and not subject to legal hold or deemed of permanent value, will be disposed of (e.g., securely deleted). Disposition actions, especially for critical assets, may require documented approval.
- **Legal Holds:** If a knowledge asset is subject to a legal hold, its disposition is suspended until the hold is lifted. The Legal department notifies the KM Unit and IT of required holds.

## 8. Tools and Technology

KM platforms and document management systems may incorporate features to automate aspects of retention management, such as setting review dates, flagging content for review, and facilitating archival/disposition workflows. IT and KM will collaborate on configuring and utilizing these features.

## 9. Policy Compliance

Adherence to this policy and the associated Retention Schedule is mandatory. Unauthorized destruction of records/knowledge required for retention, or failure to dispose of assets past their retention date (without valid reason like a legal hold), may result in disciplinary action and potential legal/regulatory consequences.

## 10. Review and Updates

This policy and the associated Knowledge Retention Schedule will be reviewed annually (or more frequently if required by significant legal or business changes) by the KM Unit, Legal/Compliance, and other key stakeholders. Updates will be communicated throughout the organization.
