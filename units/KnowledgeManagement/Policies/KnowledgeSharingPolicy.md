- **Responsibility:** Individuals are responsible for sharing knowledge relevant to their roles and expertise and for ensuring the information shared is accurate to the best of their knowledge.
- **Security:** Adhere strictly to the [Data Classification Policy (KM Context)](DataClassificationPolicy.md) and information security policies when sharing sensitive or confidential information. Use secure channels for restricted information.
- **Collaboration:** Foster collaboration by actively participating in knowledge-sharing activities, forums, and communities.

## 5. Responsibilities

- **All Employees:** Responsible for actively sharing relevant knowledge and expertise through approved channels, seeking knowledge from others when needed, and participating in knowledge-sharing initiatives. Expected to keep their expert profiles (if applicable) updated.
- **Managers/Team Leads:** Responsible for creating an environment within their teams that encourages and facilitates knowledge sharing, recognizing and rewarding sharing behaviors, and ensuring team members have access to necessary tools and training.

- **Official Knowledge Repositories:** (e.g., Knowledge Base, Document Management System, Wiki) - For structured, validated, and persistent knowledge assets.
- **Collaboration Platforms:** (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, Intranet Forums) - For informal sharing, discussions, quick questions, and team collaboration.
- **Communities of Practice (CoPs):** Formal or informal groups focused on specific topics or disciplines for sharing expertise, best practices, and lessons learned.
- **Email:** For targeted, person-to-person communication. Avoid using email as a primary knowledge repository; transfer valuable information to official repositories when appropriate.

## 9. Policy Compliance

Adherence to this policy is expected of all employees.

Hindering knowledge sharing or creating knowledge silos is discouraged and may be addressed through performance management.

## 10. Review and Updates
