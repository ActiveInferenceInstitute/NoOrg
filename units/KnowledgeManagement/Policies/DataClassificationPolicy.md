# Data Classification Policy (Knowledge Management Context)

## 1. Policy Statement

This policy establishes a framework for classifying organizational knowledge assets based on their level of sensitivity, criticality, and confidentiality. Proper classification ensures that knowledge assets are appropriately protected, shared, and handled throughout their lifecycle, aligning with organizational security postures and compliance obligations.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:
- Define standardized classification levels for knowledge assets.
- Ensure that knowledge creators and owners understand their responsibility to classify assets correctly.
- Provide clear guidelines on handling requirements (access control, sharing, storage, transmission, retention, disposal) for each classification level.
- Support compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and other legal/contractual requirements.
- Protect the organization's reputation, intellectual property, and operational integrity by preventing unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive knowledge.
- Integrate knowledge classification with the overall organizational data classification scheme.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all organizational knowledge assets managed within the scope of the KM program, regardless of format (digital or physical) or location. It applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who create, access, handle, or manage organizational knowledge.

This policy should be read in conjunction with the organization's overarching Information Security Policy and Data Governance Policy.

## 4. Principles

- **Alignment:** Classification levels defined herein should align with, or map directly to, the broader organizational data classification scheme.
- **Least Privilege:** Access to knowledge assets should be granted based on the principle of least privilege â€“ only authorized individuals with a legitimate business need should have access, particularly for higher classification levels.
- **Responsibility:** The individual creating or owning a knowledge asset is primarily responsible for assigning the correct initial classification.
- **Clarity:** Classification levels and handling requirements must be clearly defined and communicated.
- **Regular Review:** Classification levels should be reviewed periodically, especially if the content or context of the knowledge asset changes.

## 5. Classification Levels

The organization adopts the following classification levels for its knowledge assets. [Note: These are common examples. The organization must define its specific levels based on its risk assessment and existing security framework. Ensure alignment with the corporate standard.]

- **Level 1: Public**
    - **Definition:** Information intended for public release or information that carries no risk to the organization if disclosed.
    - **Examples:** Marketing materials already published, public website content, press releases.
    - **Handling Requirements:** No restrictions on access or sharing. Can be stored on any organizational system. Disposal typically involves simple deletion.

- **Level 2: Internal Use**
    - **Definition:** Information intended for use by employees and authorized contractors within the organization. Disclosure outside the organization could cause minimal harm or operational inconvenience.
    - **Examples:** General operational procedures, internal announcements, non-sensitive meeting minutes, most knowledge base articles, internal training materials.
    - **Handling Requirements:** Accessible to employees and authorized contractors based on role/need. Should not be shared externally without authorization. Store on internal systems (e.g., intranet, internal KM platform). Standard disposal procedures.

- **Level 3: Confidential**
    - **Definition:** Sensitive information intended for specific groups or individuals within the organization on a need-to-know basis. Unauthorized disclosure could adversely impact operations, finances, reputation, partners, or employees.
    - **Examples:** Project-specific details before launch, internal financial data (not yet public), pre-release product information, some research data, sensitive operational metrics, minutes from sensitive meetings.
    - **Handling Requirements:** Access restricted to authorized personnel only (often via specific permissions). Sharing requires owner approval and must use secure channels. Encryption may be required for storage and transmission. Store in controlled environments. Secure disposal methods required.

- **Level 4: Restricted / Highly Confidential**
    - **Definition:** Highly sensitive information, typically subject to legal, regulatory, or contractual restrictions. Unauthorized disclosure could cause severe financial, legal, or reputational damage, or violate privacy laws.
    - **Examples:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), critical intellectual property, trade secrets, strategic M&A information, security vulnerabilities, data subject to strict NDAs.
    - **Handling Requirements:** Access strictly controlled on a need-to-know basis with explicit authorization. Strong encryption required for storage and transmission. Often stored in dedicated secure systems. Sharing is highly restricted and tracked. Strict, verifiable secure disposal methods mandatory.

## 6. Responsibilities

- **Knowledge Creators/Owners:** Responsible for assigning an initial classification level upon creation, ensuring appropriate handling based on classification, and reviewing/updating classification as needed.
- **Managers/Team Leads:** Responsible for ensuring their team members understand and comply with this policy and for overseeing access management within their area.
- **Knowledge Consumers/Users:** Responsible for handling knowledge assets according to their classification level and reporting any potential misclassifications or security incidents.
- **Knowledge Management (KM) Unit:** Responsible for promoting awareness of the classification policy, integrating classification into KM tools and processes, providing guidance, and potentially assisting with audits or reviews.
- **Information Security Department:** Responsible for defining the overarching classification framework, providing security tools and technologies (e.g., encryption, access controls), monitoring for compliance, and managing security incidents related to data breaches.
- **IT Department:** Responsible for implementing and maintaining technical controls supporting the classification scheme (e.g., permissions, secure storage).

## 7. Procedures

- **Classification Assignment:** Creators assign classification based on content sensitivity, source, and potential impact if disclosed. If unsure, err on the side of a higher classification and consult the KM Unit or Information Security.
- **Labeling:** Where feasible, knowledge assets (especially documents) should be labeled with their classification level (e.g., in header/footer).
- **Access Control:** Access permissions in KM systems, repositories, and collaboration tools must be configured to reflect the classification levels.
- **Sharing:** Adhere strictly to the handling requirements for sharing based on classification (see Section 5). Use secure methods for Confidential and Restricted information.
- **Storage:** Store assets in systems approved for their classification level.
- **Review:** Periodically review asset classification, especially before wider sharing or migration.
- **Disposal:** Follow secure disposal procedures appropriate for the classification level, coordinated with the [Knowledge Retention Policy](KnowledgeRetentionPolicy.md) and IT.

## 8. Training

All employees and relevant contractors will receive training on this Data Classification Policy and their responsibilities.

## 9. Policy Compliance

Non-compliance with this policy, especially mishandling of Confidential or Restricted knowledge assets, can lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may have legal consequences for the individual and the organization.

## 10. Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually by the KM Unit and Information Security Department and updated as necessary to align with organizational changes, regulatory updates, or evolving threats.
