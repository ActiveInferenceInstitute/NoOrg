## Definitions

**Community of Practice (CoP)**: A group of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis.

**Domain**: The specific area of knowledge, expertise, or practice that brings the community together and defines its identity.
