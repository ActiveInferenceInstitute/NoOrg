# Innovation Projects

This directory tracks individual innovation projects and initiatives managed by the Innovation Unit.

## Structure for Each Project

Each project should reside in its own folder named using the convention:

```
YYYYMMDD_ProjectName
```

Within each project folder, maintain the following subdirectories:

- `docs/` : Detailed project documentation, business cases, research outputs.
- `experiments/` : Experiment plans and results specific to this project.
- `prototypes/` : Prototype artifacts and iteration history.
- `reports/` : Project-specific progress, pilot, and final reports.
- `assets/` : Supporting materials (images, presentations, datasets).
- `meeting-notes/` : Notes from project meetings and workshops.

Use this structure to ensure consistency, traceability, and easy access to project information.
