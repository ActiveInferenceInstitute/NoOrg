# Innovation Lifecycle Process

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Process Owner:** Head of Innovation

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the end-to-end process for managing innovation within [Organization Name], from initial idea generation through to potential scaling or termination. It provides a structured framework to guide ideas through stages of increasing maturity and investment.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all ideas and projects formally entering the innovation pipeline managed by the Innovation Unit.

## 3. Process Overview

The innovation lifecycle consists of several distinct stages, each with specific objectives, activities, deliverables, and decision gates. Progression from one stage to the next typically requires a formal review and approval based on predefined criteria.

**Visual Representation:** See the [Innovation Lifecycle Process Diagram](../Diagrams/Innovation_Lifecycle_Process_Diagram.md).

## 4. Process Stages

### Stage 1: Ideation & Submission
- **Objective:** Generate, capture, and submit new ideas addressing strategic opportunities or challenges.
- **Activities:** Brainstorming, market research, trend analysis, problem identification, idea submission using the designated channel.
- **Key Input:** Problems, opportunities, insights, raw ideas.
- **Key Output:** Formally submitted idea document (using [Idea Submission Form](../Templates/Idea_Submission_Form.md)).
- **Governance:** Governed by the [Idea Submission Policy](../Policies/Idea_Submission_Policy.md).
- **Gate 1:** Initial Screening (Completeness, duplication, basic strategic fit). Decision: Proceed to Evaluation or Reject/Hold.

### Stage 2: Evaluation & Concept Development
- **Objective:** Evaluate submitted ideas for potential and feasibility; develop promising ideas into initial concepts.
- **Activities:** Idea assessment against criteria (see policy), preliminary market analysis, technical feasibility check, concept outlining, initial risk assessment.
- **Key Input:** Submitted idea document.
- **Key Output:** Concept brief, evaluation scorecard, initial validation plan.
- **Governance:** Evaluation by [Review Body]; adherence to [Idea Submission Policy](../Policies/Idea_Submission_Policy.md).
- **Gate 2:** Concept Review. Decision: Proceed to Experimentation, Hold, or Reject.

### Stage 3: Experimentation & Validation
- **Objective:** Test critical assumptions, validate the core value proposition, and reduce uncertainty through focused experiments.
- **Activities:** Hypothesis formulation, experiment design (using [Experiment Plan Template](../Templates/Experiment_Plan_Template.md)), prototyping (MVP), user testing, data collection & analysis, iteration based on feedback.
- **Key Input:** Concept brief, validation plan.
- **Key Output:** Experiment results (using [Experiment Results Template](../Reports/Experiment_Results_Template.md)), validated learnings, refined prototype/MVP, updated business case/proposal.
- **Governance:** Governed by [Experimentation Policy](../Policies/Experimentation_Policy.md); potential funding approval via [Innovation Funding Policy](../Policies/Innovation_Funding_Policy.md).
- **Gate 3:** Validation Review. Decision: Proceed to Pilot, Pivot (return to Stage 2/3), or Terminate.

### Stage 4: Pilot & Business Case Refinement
- **Objective:** Test the solution in a controlled real-world or simulated environment; refine the business model and operational plan.
- **Activities:** Pilot program design and execution, gathering operational data, customer feedback collection, refining technical solution, developing detailed business case and implementation plan.
- **Key Input:** Validated learnings, refined prototype/MVP, updated business case.
- **Key Output:** Pilot results report, finalized business case, go-to-market/implementation strategy, IP disclosure (if applicable, see [IP Policy](../Policies/Intellectual_Property_Policy.md)).
- **Governance:** Funding via [Innovation Funding Policy](../Policies/Innovation_Funding_Policy.md); adherence to relevant operational/compliance policies.
- **Gate 4:** Pre-Scale/Implementation Review. Decision: Proceed to Scale/Implement, Further Refine, or Terminate.

### Stage 5: Scaling / Implementation / Transition
- **Objective:** Launch the validated solution at scale, integrate it into operations, or transition it to a relevant business unit.
- **Activities:** Full-scale development, operational rollout, marketing and sales launch (if applicable), knowledge transfer, handover to operational owner.
- **Key Input:** Finalized business case, implementation plan, pilot results.
- **Key Output:** Launched product/service/process, operational handover documentation, post-launch monitoring plan.
- **Governance:** Typically transitions to standard project management and operational governance frameworks.
- **Gate 5:** Post-Launch Review (typically conducted by the receiving unit). Assessment of initial performance against goals.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Innovation Unit:** Facilitates the process, manages the pipeline, supports project teams, coordinates reviews.
- **Project Teams/Idea Owners:** Drive the idea through the stages, conduct activities, prepare deliverables.
- **Review Bodies/Gatekeepers:** Evaluate progress and make decisions at stage gates.
- **Stakeholders/Sponsors:** Provide input, resources, and support.
- **Process Owner:** Maintains and improves this process document.
