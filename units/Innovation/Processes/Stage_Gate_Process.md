# Innovation Stage-Gate Process

## Purpose

To provide a structured framework for evaluating and advancing innovation projects through key decision points (gates), ensuring alignment with strategy and effective resource allocation.

## Scope

This process applies to prioritized innovation projects undertaken by the [[../Innovation_Overview.md|Innovation Unit]] following initial idea screening (see [[Idea_Submission_Process.md]]).

## Stages & Gates

*(Note: The specific stages and gate criteria should be customized)*

**Stage 0: Idea** (Input from [[Idea_Submission_Process.md]])

**Gate 1: Initial Concept Review**
*   **Criteria:** Strategic fit, problem/opportunity clarity, initial feasibility assessment, potential impact.
*   **Decision:** Proceed to Stage 1 / Hold / Kill.

**Stage 1: Concept Development & Feasibility**
*   **Activities:** Market research, technical feasibility study, preliminary business case, concept definition.
*   **Deliverables:** Concept document, initial risk assessment (links to [[../Risk_Management.md]]).

**Gate 2: Feasibility & Business Case Review**
*   **Criteria:** Validated feasibility, refined business case, clear value proposition, resource estimation.
*   **Decision:** Proceed to Stage 2 / Hold / Recycle / Kill.

**Stage 2: Prototyping & Validation**
*   **Activities:** Develop prototype(s), conduct user testing/feedback, refine technical solution, detailed project planning.
*   **Deliverables:** Functional prototype, validation results, detailed project plan.

**Gate 3: Prototype & Plan Review**
*   **Criteria:** Successful prototype validation, confirmed technical viability, robust project plan, resource commitment.
*   **Decision:** Proceed to Stage 3 / Hold / Recycle / Kill.

**Stage 3: Pilot & Pre-launch**
*   **Activities:** Develop pilot program, conduct pilot testing in target environment, finalize launch plan, secure operational readiness (liaise with e.g. [[../Interfaces.md|Development, Marketing]]).
*   **Deliverables:** Pilot results, launch plan, transition plan.

**Gate 4: Launch Decision**
*   **Criteria:** Successful pilot, confirmed business case, launch readiness, resource allocation for launch.
*   **Decision:** Proceed to Launch (Transition) / Hold / Kill.

**Stage 4: Launch & Transition**
*   **Activities:** Execute launch plan, handover to operational teams (e.g., [[../Interfaces.md|Product Management, Development]]), monitor initial performance (links to [[../Performance_Metrics.md]]).

## Governance

*   **Gatekeepers:** [Define who makes the decisions at each gate, e.g., Innovation Council, Unit Leadership]. See [[../Strategic_Management.md#Governance and Decision Making]].
*   **Documentation:** Templates for deliverables at each stage (See [[../Templates/]]).
