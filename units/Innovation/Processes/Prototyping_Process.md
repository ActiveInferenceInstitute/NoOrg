# Prototyping Process

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Process Owner:** Innovation Manager / Lead Designer/Engineer

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the recommended process for creating prototypes as part of the innovation lifecycle, primarily during the Experimentation & Validation stage. Prototyping helps to visualize concepts, test usability, gather feedback, and refine solutions before significant investment.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to the development of various fidelity prototypes (e.g., sketches, wireframes, mockups, functional prototypes, proofs-of-concept) for innovation projects managed by the Innovation Unit.

## 3. Process Overview

The prototyping process is typically iterative and integrated within the experimentation cycle. It focuses on building just enough of a solution to test a specific hypothesis or gather targeted feedback.

## 4. Process Steps

1.  **Define Prototyping Goals:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Clearly articulate what the prototype aims to achieve. What specific questions does it need to answer? What assumptions does it test? (Refer to the [Experiment Plan](../Templates/Experiment_Plan_Template.md)).
    *   **Output:** Defined goals and scope for the prototype.

2.  **Select Fidelity Level:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Choose the appropriate level of detail and functionality based on the goals, stage of development, audience, and available resources.
        *   *Low-Fidelity (e.g., sketches, paper prototypes):* For early concept exploration and workflow validation.
        *   *Medium-Fidelity (e.g., wireframes, basic digital mockups):* For usability testing, layout refinement, information architecture.
        *   *High-Fidelity (e.g., interactive mockups, functional prototypes):* For detailed UI testing, demonstrating core functionality, stakeholder presentations.
    *   **Output:** Selected fidelity level and justification.

3.  **Choose Tools & Techniques:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Select appropriate tools (e.g., whiteboards, paper, Figma, Sketch, InVision, specific coding libraries, hardware components) based on fidelity, team skills, and project needs.
    *   **Output:** Identified tools and techniques.

4.  **Develop Prototype:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team (Designers, Engineers, Subject Matter Experts)
    *   **Action:** Build the prototype according to the defined scope and fidelity. Focus on the core elements needed to meet the goals, avoiding unnecessary features ('gold plating'). Iterate as needed based on internal reviews.
    *   **Output:** Prototype artifact(s).

5.  **Prepare for Testing/Feedback:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Define the feedback or testing session plan. Who is the audience (users, stakeholders)? What tasks will they perform? What specific feedback is sought? Prepare any necessary scripts or scenarios.
    *   **Output:** Testing/feedback plan.

6.  **Conduct Testing/Gather Feedback:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team, Testers/Users/Stakeholders
    *   **Action:** Execute the feedback session (e.g., usability test, demo, walkthrough). Observe users, collect comments, and record findings systematically.
    *   **Output:** Raw feedback data and observations.

7.  **Analyze Feedback & Iterate:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Synthesize the feedback, identify key insights and areas for improvement. Decide on next steps: refine the prototype, pivot the concept, or conclude the specific test.
    *   **Output:** Analyzed feedback, documented learnings, decision on next iteration.

8.  **Document & Share:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Document the prototype (its purpose, version, key features) and the findings from testing/feedback. Share relevant learnings with the Innovation Unit and stakeholders. Update the [Experiment Results](../Reports/Experiment_Results_Template.md).
    *   **Output:** Documented prototype and feedback summary.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Start Simple:** Begin with low-fidelity prototypes to explore concepts quickly and cheaply.
- **Focus on Goals:** Build only what is necessary to test the hypothesis or gather the needed feedback.
- **Iterate Quickly:** Embrace feedback and iterate rapidly.
- **Don't Strive for Perfection:** Prototypes are learning tools, not final products.
- **Test with Real Users:** Whenever possible, get feedback from the target audience.
- **Consider Constraints:** Build prototypes with realistic technical or operational constraints in mind where appropriate.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Team:** Responsible for the entire prototyping cycle within their project.
- **Designers/UX Specialists:** Often lead the design and usability aspects of prototyping.
- **Engineers/Developers:** Often lead the development of functional or technical prototypes.
- **Innovation Unit:** Provides guidance, resources (tools, labs if applicable), and potentially connects teams with testing resources.
