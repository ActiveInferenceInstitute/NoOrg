# Experiment Tracking Process

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Process Owner:** Innovation Manager

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the process for tracking active innovation experiments within [Organization Name]. It ensures visibility into ongoing experiments, monitors progress against plans, facilitates resource management, and captures key learnings systematically.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all formally approved experiments undertaken as part of the Innovation Lifecycle, particularly during Stage 3 (Experimentation & Validation).

## 3. Process Overview

Approved experiments are logged, monitored through regular check-ins, and their results are captured and archived for future reference and organizational learning.

## 4. Process Steps

1.  **Experiment Registration:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team / Innovation Unit Staff
    *   **Action:** Once an experiment is approved (based on the [Experimentation Policy](../Policies/Experimentation_Policy.md) and potentially the [Innovation Funding Policy](../Policies/Innovation_Funding_Policy.md)), it is formally registered in the [Experiment Tracking System/Tool, e.g., Project Management Software, Spreadsheet, Database].
    *   **Input:** Approved [Experiment Plan](../Templates/Experiment_Plan_Template.md).
    *   **Data Captured:** Experiment ID, Project Name, Owner, Start/End Dates, Hypothesis, Key Metrics, Budget, Status (e.g., Planned, Active, Completed, Paused).
    *   **Output:** Registered experiment record.

2.  **Regular Check-ins/Updates:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team, Innovation Manager/Facilitator
    *   **Action:** Conduct regular (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly) brief check-ins to discuss progress, roadblocks, preliminary findings, and any necessary adjustments to the plan.
    *   **Frequency:** Defined based on experiment duration and complexity.
    *   **Input:** Previous updates, current progress, emerging issues.
    *   **Output:** Updated experiment status in the tracking system, documented discussion points/actions.

3.  **Monitoring Key Metrics:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Continuously or periodically collect data related to the key success metrics defined in the experiment plan.
    *   **Input:** Raw data from experiment execution.
    *   **Output:** Analyzed metric data.

4.  **Risk & Issue Management:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team, Innovation Manager
    *   **Action:** Identify and log any new risks or issues encountered during the experiment. Escalate significant issues to stakeholders or the [Decision Body] as needed. Update mitigation plans.
    *   **Input:** Observations, check-in discussions.
    *   **Output:** Logged risks/issues, updated mitigation status.

5.  **Experiment Completion & Results Capture:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team
    *   **Action:** Upon completion of the experiment (or reaching a significant milestone/decision point), finalize data analysis and document the outcomes, key learnings, and recommendations in the [Experiment Results Template](../Reports/Experiment_Results_Template.md).
    *   **Input:** All collected data, check-in notes, metric analysis.
    *   **Output:** Completed experiment results document.

6.  **Archive and Update Tracking System:**
    *   **Actor:** Project Team / Innovation Unit Staff
    *   **Action:** Archive the final experiment results document. Update the status of the experiment in the tracking system to 'Completed'. Record key outcomes/learnings in the system for easy reference.
    *   **Input:** Completed experiment results document.
    *   **Output:** Archived results, updated experiment record in tracking system.

7.  **Portfolio Review:**
    *   **Actor:** Innovation Unit / [Decision Body]
    *   **Action:** Periodically review the portfolio of active and completed experiments to identify trends, assess overall progress towards innovation goals, and inform future strategy and resource allocation.
    *   **Input:** Data from the experiment tracking system, individual results reports.
    *   **Output:** Portfolio insights, strategic recommendations.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Team:** Executes the experiment, provides regular updates, collects data, documents results.
- **Innovation Manager/Facilitator:** Oversees the tracking process, facilitates check-ins, assists with issue resolution, maintains the tracking system.
- **Innovation Unit:** Manages the overall experiment portfolio, conducts portfolio reviews.
- **[Decision Body]:** Receives escalated issues, reviews overall portfolio performance.
- **Process Owner:** Maintains and improves this process document.

## 6. Tools

- **[Experiment Tracking System/Tool]:** Central repository for experiment information (e.g., Jira, Trello, Asana, dedicated innovation software, shared spreadsheet).
- **Collaboration Tools:** For check-ins and communication (e.g., Slack, Teams, Email).
- **Documentation Repository:** Where plans and results are stored (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint, Git repository).
