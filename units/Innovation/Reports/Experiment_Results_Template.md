## 4. Key Learnings & Insights

*(Based on the results, what was learned? Were the hypotheses validated or invalidated? What were the surprising findings?)*

- **Learning 1:** [Description]
- **Learning 2:** [Description]
- **Hypothesis Validation:** [Explicitly state whether the core hypothesis was supported, partially supported, or refuted by the evidence.]

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendation

*(Based on the learnings, what is the recommendation for the next step?)*

- **Conclusion:** [Summarize the implications of the findings.]
- **Recommendation:** [Choose one and elaborate]
    - **Persevere:** Proceed to the next stage/experiment with minor adjustments based on learnings. [Justification]
    - **Pivot:** Modify the concept/approach significantly based on learnings and conduct further validation. [Description of pivot and justification]
    - **Stop/Terminate:** The hypothesis was invalidated, and further investment is not recommended. [Justification]
- **Next Steps:** [If Persevering or Pivoting, outline the immediate next steps planned.]
