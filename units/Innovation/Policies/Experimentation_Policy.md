# Experimentation Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Approved By:** [Approving Body/Person Name, e.g., Innovation Steering Committee]
**Policy Owner:** Head of Innovation

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines and principles for conducting experiments within [Organization Name] as part of the innovation process. The goal is to encourage validated learning, manage risks associated with testing new ideas, and ensure responsible use of resources.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all innovation projects and initiatives undertaken by or involving the Innovation Unit and any other departments engaging in formal experimentation related to new products, services, processes, or business models.

## 3. Policy Statement

[Organization Name] supports controlled experimentation as a critical method for validating assumptions, reducing uncertainty, and making informed decisions about pursuing innovative ideas. Experiments should be designed to generate actionable insights efficiently and ethically.

## 4. Principles of Experimentation

- **Validated Learning:** Experiments should be designed to test specific, critical assumptions and generate measurable evidence.
- **Iterative Approach:** Start with small, low-cost experiments and iterate based on learnings.
- **Risk Management:** Identify and mitigate potential risks associated with experiments (e.g., financial, reputational, operational, ethical).
- **Transparency:** Experiment plans, progress, and results should be documented and shared appropriately.
- **Ethical Conduct:** Experiments involving customers, employees, or sensitive data must adhere to ethical guidelines and relevant regulations (e.g., privacy policies, informed consent).
- **Resource Efficiency:** Experiments should be scoped appropriately to conserve resources while maximizing learning.

## 5. Experimentation Process

1.  **Hypothesis Formulation:** Clearly define the core assumption(s) the experiment aims to test.
2.  **Experiment Design:** Develop a plan outlining:
    *   Objectives and success metrics (quantifiable).
    *   Methodology (e.g., A/B test, prototype testing, pilot program).
    *   Target audience/segment (if applicable).
    *   Duration and timeline.
    *   Required resources (budget, personnel, tools).
    *   Risk assessment and mitigation plan.
    *   Data collection and analysis plan.
    *   (Use [Experiment Plan Template](../Templates/Experiment_Plan_Template.md)).
3.  **Approval:** Depending on the scale, risk, and resource requirements, experiments may require approval from [Approving Authority, e.g., Innovation Manager, Head of Innovation, Steering Committee]. Small, low-risk experiments may be pre-approved within certain boundaries.
4.  **Execution:** Conduct the experiment according to the approved plan.
5.  **Data Collection & Analysis:** Gather and analyze data based on the defined metrics.
6.  **Learning & Reporting:** Document findings, extract insights, and report results using the [Experiment Results Template](../Reports/Experiment_Results_Template.md).
7.  **Decision Making:** Use experiment results to inform decisions (e.g., pivot, persevere, stop).

## 6. Risk Management and Ethics

- All experiments must undergo a risk assessment appropriate to their scale.
- Experiments involving human subjects (customers, employees) require specific ethical considerations, including informed consent and data privacy adherence. Consult with [Legal/Compliance Department] if unsure.
- Experiments should minimize potential negative impacts on participants, operations, and brand reputation.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Teams/Experiment Owners:** Responsible for designing, planning, executing, and reporting on experiments.
- **Innovation Unit:** Provides guidance, tools, and resources; facilitates approvals; tracks experiments.
- **Approving Authority:** Reviews and approves experiment plans based on defined criteria.
- **Legal/Compliance:** Provides guidance on ethical and regulatory requirements.
- **Policy Owner:** Maintains and updates this policy.
