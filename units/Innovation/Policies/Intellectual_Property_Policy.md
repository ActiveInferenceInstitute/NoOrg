**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Approved By:** [Approving Body/Person Name, e.g., Legal Department Head, Innovation Steering Committee]
**Policy Owner:** Head of Innovation / Head of Legal

## 1. Purpose

This policy provides guidance on the identification, protection, and management of Intellectual Property (IP) generated through innovation activities conducted within or sponsored by [Organization Name]. It aims to ensure that valuable IP is appropriately secured and leveraged in alignment with organizational strategy, while complementing the main [Organization-wide IP Policy Document Name/Link].

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and collaborators involved in innovation projects and activities managed or supported by the Innovation Unit. It covers IP including, but not limited to, inventions, discoveries, software code, designs, data, content, processes, and trade secrets conceived or developed during these activities.

## 3. Policy Statement

[Organization Name] recognizes that IP generated through innovation is a valuable asset. The organization asserts ownership over IP created by employees within the scope of their employment or using significant organizational resources, as detailed in the [Organization-wide IP Policy Document Name/Link]. This policy supplement outlines procedures specific to the innovation context.

## 4. Key Principles

- **Early Identification:** Potential IP should be identified as early as possible in the innovation lifecycle.
- **Disclosure:** All potentially valuable IP generated through innovation activities must be promptly disclosed to the [Designated Body, e.g., Innovation Unit/Legal Department] using the appropriate channels/forms.
- **Protection Strategy:** Decisions regarding IP protection (e.g., patents, trademarks, copyright, trade secrets) will be made collaboratively between the Innovation Unit, Legal Department, and relevant stakeholders, considering commercial potential, strategic value, and cost.
- **Confidentiality:** Participants in innovation projects must maintain confidentiality regarding sensitive information and potential IP, both internally and externally, unless authorized.
- **Collaboration Agreements:** IP ownership and rights must be clearly defined in agreements with external collaborators (partners, universities, contractors) before commencing joint innovation activities.

## 5. Procedures in the Innovation Context

1.  **IP Awareness:** The Innovation Unit will promote awareness of IP considerations among project teams.
2.  **Disclosure:** Project teams must formally disclose potential inventions or significant IP using the [Organization's Standard Invention Disclosure Form/Process Link] and notify the Innovation Unit.
3.  **Initial Assessment:** The Innovation Unit, in consultation with Legal, will conduct an initial assessment of disclosed IP for novelty, potential value, and strategic relevance.
4.  **Protection Decision:** Based on the assessment, the [Decision-Making Body, e.g., IP Committee, Legal Dept.] will determine the appropriate protection strategy (e.g., file patent, maintain as trade secret, publish, release as open source).
5.  **External Collaboration:** Before engaging external parties, project leads must consult with the Legal Department to ensure appropriate agreements (e.g., NDAs, Collaboration Agreements, Research Agreements) are in place defining IP ownership, usage rights, and confidentiality.
6.  **Use of Third-Party IP:** Project teams must ensure they have the necessary rights and licenses to use any third-party IP (including open-source software) in their innovation projects and comply with associated terms.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities
