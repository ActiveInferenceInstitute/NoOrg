| **[Primary Metric 1]**     | [How it relates to the hypothesis]           | [e.g., > X% conversion] | [e.g., Analytics Tool]     |
| **[Primary Metric 2]**     | [How it relates to the hypothesis]           | [e.g., < Y seconds]     | [e.g., Manual Observation] |
| **[Secondary Metric 1]**   | [Other useful data points to capture]        | [N/A or specific goal] | [e.g., Survey Results]     |
| *... (add more as needed)* |                                              |                        |                            |

## 7. Data Collection & Analysis Plan

- **Collection Process:** [How and when will data be collected?]
- **Analysis Method:** [How will the data be analyzed to draw conclusions? (e.g., Statistical comparison, thematic analysis of feedback)]

## 8. Resources Required

- **Personnel:** [List team members and roles, any required external support]
- **Budget:** [Estimated cost, link to funding request if applicable]
- **Tools/Technology:** [Software, hardware, subscriptions needed]
- **Other:** [e.g., Access to specific data, legal review]

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

*(Identify potential risks associated with running this experiment and how they will be managed.)*

| Risk Description                          | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Impact (H/M/L) | Mitigation Plan                                     |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| [e.g., Low participant recruitment rate]  | M                  | M              | [e.g., Offer incentives, expand recruitment channels] |
| [e.g., Technical failure of prototype]    | L                  | H              | [e.g., Pre-test thoroughly, have backup plan]       |
| [e.g., Negative impact on brand perception]| L                  | M              | [e.g., Limit test scope, clear communication]       |
| *... (add more as needed)*                |                    |                |                                                     |
