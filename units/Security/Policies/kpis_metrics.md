# Security KPIs and Metrics

## Overview

Security performance indicators measuring protection effectiveness across physical, digital, and cognitive security domains.

## Security KPIs

| KPI | Target | Frequency | Owner |
|-----|--------|-----------|-------|
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | <1 hour | Continuous | SOC Lead |
| Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) | <4 hours | Continuous | Incident Manager |
| Vulnerability Remediation | Critical: 24h, High: 72h | Weekly | Vulnerability Mgr |
| Phishing Click Rate | <3% | Monthly | Awareness Lead |
| Patch Compliance | 99%+ | Monthly | IT Security |
| Security Training Completion | 100% | Annual | Training Lead |
| Incident Count | Trending down | Monthly | CISO |

## Domain-Specific Metrics

### Digital Security
