# Integrated Security Strategy

## Introduction
This document outlines the organization's integrated security strategy, providing a comprehensive approach to security across physical, digital, and cognitive domains. The strategy aligns with the organization's objectives while establishing a cohesive security posture that addresses the full spectrum of security challenges.

## Strategic Framework Reference
This strategy implements the principles and methodologies defined in the [Security Framework](../../../docs/frameworks/Security/security_framework.md), which serves as the master framework for all security domains. The domain-specific frameworks further detail implementation approaches for each security area:

- [Physical Security Framework](../../../docs/frameworks/Security/physical_security_framework.md)
- [Digital Security Framework](../../../docs/frameworks/Security/digital_security_framework.md)
- [Cognitive Security Framework](../../../docs/frameworks/Security/cognitive_security_framework.md)
- [Security Framework Integration](../../../docs/frameworks/Security/security_framework_integration.md)
