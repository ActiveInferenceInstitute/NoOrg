# Security Document Catalog

## Overview
This catalog provides a comprehensive index of all security documentation across the organization. It serves as the central reference point for locating security-related documents, frameworks, policies, procedures, and other resources.

### Document Organization
The security documentation is organized into two primary locations:
- **Units Directory** (`/units/Security/`): Contains operational documentation, procedures, and unit-specific guidance
- **Frameworks Directory** (`/frameworks/Security/`): Contains the formal security frameworks that provide structured methodologies for implementing and managing security across the organization

The frameworks serve as the foundational architecture for security implementation, while the unit documentation provides operational guidance for day-to-day activities. These two components work together to create a comprehensive security management system.
