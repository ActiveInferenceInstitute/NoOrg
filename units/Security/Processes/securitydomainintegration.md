# Security Domain Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide establishes the methodologies, processes, and operational practices for integrating the organization's three security domains: Physical Security, Digital Security, and Cognitive Security. Effective integration provides a comprehensive security approach that addresses converged threats, eliminates security gaps, and maximizes protection capabilities.

## Integration Foundations

### Integration Principles
1. **Holistic Security Perspective**: View security as a unified discipline with specialized domains
2. **Coordinated Operations**: Synchronize security activities across all domains
3. **Shared Intelligence**: Exchange threat information seamlessly between domains
4. **Unified Response**: Coordinate incident management across domain boundaries
5. **Integrated Risk Management**: Assess and address risks comprehensively
6. **Collaborative Improvement**: Enhance security capabilities through cross-domain learning

### Security Convergence Model
The organization employs a Converged Security Model with three interrelated security domains:

1. **Physical Security Domain**
