# Integrated Incident Response Plan

## Overview
This Integrated Incident Response Plan establishes a comprehensive, coordinated approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents across physical, digital, and cognitive security domains, ensuring effective management of multi-domain security events.

## Scope
This plan covers all security incidents affecting organizational assets, systems, information, personnel, and operations, including incidents that span multiple security domains. It establishes the procedures, roles, and resources for effective incident management.
