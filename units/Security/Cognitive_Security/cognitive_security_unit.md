# Cognitive Security Unit

## Overview

The Cognitive Security unit, a specialized division within the Security Unit, focuses on protecting the organization's cognitive domain, including information warfare defense, psychological operations defense, and cognitive threat analysis. We safeguard against manipulation, misinformation, and cognitive-based attacks while ensuring organizational resilience.
