# Conflict Resolution Process

## 1. Purpose
To provide a structured and constructive approach for resolving workplace conflicts between employees or between employees and managers, fostering a respectful and productive work environment. This supports the principles outlined in the [[Policy:Employee_Relations]].

## 2. Scope
- Addresses interpersonal conflicts, disagreements over work processes, communication breakdowns, or other workplace disputes not rising to the level of formal harassment, discrimination, or policy violations (which follow separate investigation processes).
- Encourages informal resolution first, with options for facilitated discussion or mediation if needed.

## 3. Guiding Principles
- **Early Intervention:** Address conflicts promptly before they escalate.
- **Respect:** Treat all parties with respect throughout the process.
- **Confidentiality:** Maintain confidentiality to the extent possible.
- **Impartiality:** Facilitators or mediators must remain neutral.
- **Focus on Interests:** Aim to understand underlying interests, not just stated positions.
- **Voluntary Participation:** Mediation is typically voluntary.
- **Constructive Outcomes:** Seek mutually agreeable solutions where possible.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Conflict Identification:** A conflict arises between employees or between an employee and manager.
2.  **Informal Resolution (Preferred First Step):**
    *   The parties involved are encouraged to attempt resolving the conflict directly and respectfully through open communication.
3.  **Escalation to Manager (If Informal Fails or Inappropriate):**
    *   One or both parties may bring the unresolved conflict to their direct manager(s).
4.  **Manager Assessment & Facilitation:**
    *   The manager gathers information from the involved parties (separately or together, as appropriate) to understand the nature and scope of the conflict.
    *   The manager may facilitate a discussion between the parties, provide coaching, clarify expectations, or suggest solutions for resolution.
5.  **Consultation with HR/OD (If Manager Facilitation Fails or Requires Support):**
    *   If the conflict persists, involves complex issues, or if the manager requires support, the manager consults with HR/OD.
    *   Employees may also contact HR/OD directly if they are uncomfortable speaking with their manager or if the manager is involved in the conflict.
6.  **HR/OD Review & Guidance:**
    *   HR/OD reviews the situation, potentially speaking with the involved parties and manager.
    *   HR/OD provides guidance on potential next steps, policy implications, and resolution options.
7.  **Mediation (If Appropriate and Agreed):**
    *   If deemed appropriate and all parties voluntarily agree, HR/OD may assign a trained, neutral mediator (internal or external).
    *   The mediator facilitates confidential sessions with the parties to help them understand each other's perspectives and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
    *   If an agreement is reached, key action items are documented (maintaining confidentiality of the discussion details).
8.  **Implementation & Follow-up:**
    *   The involved parties are responsible for implementing any agreed-upon actions.
    *   The manager or HR/OD may follow up periodically to ensure the resolution is sustained.
9.  **Determining Next Steps (If No Agreement):**
    *   If mediation fails or is not pursued, HR/OD, in consultation with management, determines appropriate next steps. This might involve:
        *   Management decision/direction.
        *   Further investigation if potential policy violations emerge ([[Process:Workplace_Investigation]]).
        *   Team-based interventions.
        *   Referral to formal grievance procedures if applicable ([[Process:Formal_Grievance_Procedure]]).

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
-   **Employees:** Attempt informal resolution respectfully, participate constructively if escalated, implement agreed actions.
-   **Manager:** Facilitate informal resolution, assess escalations, provide coaching, consult HR/OD when needed, support implementation of solutions.
-   **HR/OD:** Provide guidance, determine appropriate process steps, facilitate mediation or assign mediators, advise on policy, document formal outcomes.
-   **Mediator:** Facilitate discussion impartially, maintain confidentiality, help parties explore options (does not impose solutions).
