# Training Needs Analysis (TNA) Process

## 1. Purpose
To systematically identify learning and development needs across the organization at the individual, team, and organizational levels. This process ensures that L&D initiatives are targeted, relevant, and aligned with strategic goals, skill gaps, and performance requirements.

## 2. Scope
- Identifying learning needs related to job performance, career development, compliance requirements, and strategic initiatives.
- Applicable to all departments and employee levels.
- Inputs into the overall L&D strategy and program design ([[Policy:Learning_Development]]).

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Identify Trigger/Need:** The process can be triggered by various factors:
    *   New strategic initiatives requiring new skills.
    *   Identified performance gaps (from performance reviews, KPIs).
    *   Introduction of new technology, processes, or products.
    *   New or updated compliance/regulatory requirements.
    *   Direct feedback or requests from employees or managers.
    *   Outputs from talent reviews or succession planning.
2.  **Define Scope & Objectives:** Clearly define the focus of the TNA (e.g., specific department, role, skill area, organizational level) and the desired outcomes (e.g., identify skills needed for Project X, determine root cause of performance issue Y).
3.  **Select Data Collection Methods:** Choose appropriate methods based on the scope and objectives. Often a combination of methods is most effective:
    *   Surveys (broad reach, quantitative data).
    *   Interviews (in-depth qualitative insights).
    *   Focus Groups (group perspectives, brainstorming).
    *   Performance Data Analysis (objective performance metrics).
    *   Observation (for task-specific skills).
    *   Reviewing job descriptions, competency models, previous training evaluations.
4.  **Collect Data:** Execute the chosen methods, ensuring clear communication and appropriate confidentiality/anonymity.
5.  **Analyze Data & Identify Gaps:** Analyze the collected data (both quantitative and qualitative) to identify discrepancies between current capabilities/knowledge and desired/required capabilities/knowledge.
6.  **Prioritize Needs:** Evaluate the identified gaps based on factors like strategic importance, impact, urgency, number of people affected, and resource availability (time, budget).
7.  **Develop Recommendations:** Formulate specific recommendations for addressing the prioritized needs. Recommendations should specify:
    *   Learning objectives.
    *   Target audience.
    *   Potential solution types (e.g., training course, workshop, coaching, job aid, process change).
    *   Suggested delivery methods (e.g., online, in-person, blended).
8.  **Report Findings & Recommendations:** Document the TNA findings, analysis, prioritized needs, and recommendations in a clear report. Present to relevant stakeholders (e.g., leadership, department heads, L&D team).
9.  **Develop/Source L&D Solutions:** Based on approved recommendations, design, develop, or source appropriate learning solutions (Leads into [[Process:Learning_Program_Development_Delivery]] or [[Process:Training_Request_Approval]]).
10. **Implement & Evaluate:** Implement the solutions and evaluate their effectiveness ([[Process:Training_Effectiveness_Evaluation]]), providing feedback into future TNA cycles.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
-   **OD/L&D Team:** Owns and facilitates the TNA process, selects/designs methods, collects/analyzes data, develops recommendations, prepares reports.
-   **Business Leaders/Department Heads:** Provide strategic input, identify needs within their areas, sponsor TNA initiatives, review findings.
-   **Managers:** Provide input on team/individual needs, participate in data collection, support implementation.
-   **Employees:** Participate in surveys, interviews, focus groups; provide honest feedback.
-   **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** Provide expertise on specific job roles, tasks, or technical areas.

## 5. Key Tools & Resources
-   Survey tools (e.g., Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey).
-   Interview/Focus Group Guides.
-   Data analysis software (e.g., Excel, SPSS).
-   [[Performance_Management_Software]] (Data source)
-   [[Human_Resources_Information_System_HRIS]] (Data source)
-   Job Descriptions / [[Competency_Framework]]
-   TNA Report Template.

## 6. Metrics & Evaluation
-   Timeliness of TNA completion.
-   Stakeholder satisfaction with the TNA process and report.
-   Alignment of identified needs with subsequent L&D program participation.
-   Impact of resulting L&D programs (long-term evaluation).
