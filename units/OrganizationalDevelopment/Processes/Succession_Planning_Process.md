# Succession Planning Process

## 1. Purpose
To implement the [[Policy:Succession_Planning]] by providing a structured process for identifying critical roles, assessing potential successors, facilitating talent reviews, and creating development plans to build leadership pipelines and ensure organizational continuity.

## 2. Scope
- Covers the operational steps involved in the annual (or other periodic) succession planning cycle.
- Involves Senior Leadership, Managers, OD/Talent Management, and HR.
- Focuses on designated critical roles.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Cycle Initiation & Critical Role Review (Start of Cycle):**
    *   OD/Talent Management (OD/TM) initiates the annual cycle.
    *   OD/TM reviews and proposes updates to the list of critical roles based on strategic plans and organizational structure ([[Process:Critical_Role_Identification]]).
    *   Senior Leadership reviews and validates the final list of critical roles for the cycle.
2.  **Talent Assessment & Nomination:**
    *   OD/TM launches the assessment phase, providing tools and guidelines.
    *   Managers assess their direct reports based on performance ([[Policy:Performance_Management]]) and potential, using tools like the 9-box grid or defined potential criteria.
    *   OD/TM gathers relevant supporting data (e.g., performance history, previous assessments, 360-feedback if applicable).
    *   Managers nominate high-potential employees as potential successors for critical roles within their sphere or beyond.
3.  **Data Consolidation & Preparation:**
    *   OD/TM consolidates assessment data and nominations into talent profiles.
    *   OD/TM prepares materials for talent review meetings (e.g., talent dashboards, potential successor lists per critical role, 9-box matrices).
4.  **Talent Review Meetings:**
    *   OD/TM facilitates structured talent review meetings with relevant leadership groups (e.g., Executive team, Divisional leadership).
    *   Leaders discuss talent across the organization, calibrating assessments of performance and potential.
    *   Potential successors for critical roles are discussed, debated, and confirmed.
    *   Readiness levels (e.g., Ready Now, 1-2 Years, 3+ Years) are assessed.
    *   Key development needs for identified successors and high-potentials are discussed.
5.  **Documentation & Development Planning:**
    *   OD/TM confidentially documents the key outcomes of the talent reviews, including confirmed successors and readiness.
    *   Managers, often supported by OD/TM, meet with identified successors/high-potentials to discuss feedback (appropriately framed) and create or update Individual Development Plans (IDPs).
    *   IDPs focus on bridging gaps needed for future roles (experiential learning, projects, coaching, training) - linked to [[Policy:Learning_Development]].
6.  **Implementation & Monitoring:**
    *   Managers and employees implement the agreed-upon development plans throughout the year.
    *   OD/TM monitors the progress of key talent development initiatives.
    *   Succession plans are treated as living documents and updated as needed due to promotions, departures, or changes in readiness.
7.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Outcomes and progress feed into the next annual cycle.
