## Policy Information
**Policy ID**: [POL-OD-005]
**Version**: 1.0
**Category**: Strategic/Operational
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the organization's compensation philosophy, guiding principles, and framework used to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees in alignment with our business strategy, values, and financial goals.

## Philosophy Statement
Our compensation philosophy is to provide competitive, equitable, and performance-driven total rewards programs that attract top talent, retain high-performing employees, and reinforce our culture. We aim for transparency and clarity in our compensation practices, ensuring they are market-relevant, internally fair, and fiscally responsible.

## Scope
### Applies To
- All regular employees.
- Decisions regarding base pay, variable pay (incentives/bonuses), and potentially equity and other rewards.

### Exceptions
- Executive compensation may be governed by specific plans approved by the [[BoardOfDirectors]]/[[Compensation Committee]].
- Compensation for temporary staff or contractors may follow different guidelines.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Total Rewards | The complete package offered to employees, including compensation (base, variable), benefits, recognition, development, and work-life balance. |
| Base Pay | Fixed salary or hourly wage paid to an employee for performing their job responsibilities. |
| Variable Pay | Compensation that is not fixed, often tied to individual, team, or company performance (e.g., bonuses, commissions, incentives). |
| Market Rate | The typical compensation level for a specific job in the relevant external labor market. |
| Pay Equity | Ensuring employees are paid fairly relative to others performing similar work, without regard to protected characteristics. |
| Pay Structure | Formalized system of pay ranges for different job levels or grades within the organization. |
| Compensation Committee | Board committee typically responsible for overseeing executive compensation and overall compensation strategy. |

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Market Competitiveness:** We aim to position our total compensation competitively within the relevant labor markets where we operate and compete for talent.
    - Target market position (e.g., 50th percentile, 75th percentile) will be reviewed regularly based on talent strategy and affordability.
    - Market data from reputable sources will be used for benchmarking.
2.  **Internal Equity:** We strive for fairness in pay relationships between jobs based on factors such as skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions.
    - Job evaluation methods will be used to establish internal job worth.
    - Regular pay equity analyses will be conducted.
3.  **Pay for Performance:** We believe compensation should differentiate based on individual, team, and organizational performance.
    - Variable pay programs will be designed to reward achievement of key objectives.
    - Performance ratings from the [[Policy:Performance_Management]] process will be a key input for compensation decisions (e.g., merit increases, bonus payouts).
4.  **Transparency:** We aim to communicate our compensation philosophy and practices clearly to employees, fostering understanding and trust.
    - Pay ranges for roles may be shared where appropriate and legally permissible/required.
    - Processes for pay decisions will be documented.
5.  **Affordability & Sustainability:** Our compensation programs must be financially sustainable and aligned with the organization's overall financial health and performance.
6.  **Legal Compliance:** All compensation practices must comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations (e.g., FLSA, Equal Pay Act).
