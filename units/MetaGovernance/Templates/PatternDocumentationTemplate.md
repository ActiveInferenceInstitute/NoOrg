# Governance Pattern Documentation Template

## Introduction

This template provides a standardized format for documenting governance patterns for inclusion in the [[../GovernancePatternLibrary|Governance Pattern Library]]. Following this consistent structure ensures that patterns are clearly described, properly contextualized, and include all necessary information for effective implementation.

## Instructions

1. Replace all bracketed text with appropriate content for your specific pattern
2. Include concrete examples wherever possible
3. Be specific about implementation steps and considerations
4. Reference related patterns and resources
5. Submit completed pattern documentation to the Meta-Governance Unit for review

# [Pattern Name]

## Pattern ID: [CATEGORY-SHORT_NAME-001]

**Category:** [Decision-Making/Meeting/Role/Structure/Tension/Other]  
**Complexity:** [Basic/Intermediate/Advanced]  
**Maturity:** [Emerging/Established/Mature]  

## Problem Statement

[Clearly describe the governance challenge or issue that this pattern addresses. What is the pain point or opportunity? Why is this important? What happens if this issue is not addressed?]

## Context

[Describe the situations or environments where this pattern is most applicable. Include organization types, team structures, cultural contexts, or other factors that influence the pattern's applicability. Also note contexts where this pattern may NOT be appropriate.]

## Notes for Pattern Developers

- Ensure pattern documentation is clear enough for someone unfamiliar with the pattern to understand and implement it
- Include specific examples from real implementations whenever possible
- Use plain language and define any specialized terms
- Consider including visual representations (link to diagrams) when helpful
- Update the metadata section whenever the pattern is revised
- Submit completed patterns to the [[ResponsibilitiesAndAuthorities#Pattern Library Curator|Pattern Library Curator]] for review
