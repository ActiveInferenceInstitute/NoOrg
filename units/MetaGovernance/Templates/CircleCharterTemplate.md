# Circle Charter Template

## Introduction

This template guides the creation of a governance circle charter for use within fractal governance structures. Circles are the primary organizational units in fractal governance systems, with clear purposes, domains, and governance processes.

## Instructions

1. Replace all bracketed text with appropriate content for your specific circle
2. Remove any sections that do not apply to your context
3. Add additional sections as needed for your specific requirements
4. Review the completed charter with all circle members
5. Obtain any necessary approvals before finalizing
