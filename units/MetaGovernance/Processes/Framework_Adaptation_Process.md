# Framework Adaptation Process

## Purpose

This process guides the adaptation of meta-governance frameworks to specific organizational contexts while maintaining essential fractal and scale-free principles. It ensures that governance patterns can be effectively customized without losing their fundamental characteristics.

## Scope

This process applies to:
- Adaptation of the [[../FractalGovernanceFramework|Fractal Governance Framework]]
- Adaptation of the [[../ScaleFreeGovernance|Scale-Free Governance Model]]
- Adaptation of the [[../CrossOrganizationalGovernance|Cross-Organizational Governance Protocol]]
- Integration of multiple frameworks within a specific context

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Framework Adaptation Lead** | Coordinates the overall adaptation process; ensures integrity of core principles |
| **Local Context Expert** | Provides deep understanding of the specific organizational context |
| **Pattern Analyst** | Identifies which patterns are most relevant and how they should be adapted |
| **Implementation Coach** | Supports stakeholders in understanding and implementing adapted patterns |
| **Governance Steward** | Ensures ongoing alignment between adapted framework and evolving needs |

## Process Flow

### 1. Context Assessment (1-2 weeks)

1.1. **Map Current State**
   - Document existing governance structures and processes
   - Identify pain points and opportunities in current governance
   - Assess organizational culture and readiness for change

1.2. **Define Adaptation Goals**
   - Clarify specific outcomes sought through framework adaptation
   - Identify constraints and requirements specific to the context
   - Establish success criteria for the adapted framework

1.3. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Identify key stakeholders affected by the governance changes
   - Conduct interviews and workshops to understand needs and concerns
   - Create a stakeholder engagement plan for the adaptation process

**Output:** Context Assessment Report and Adaptation Goals Document

### 2. Pattern Selection (2-3 weeks)

2.1. **Review Pattern Library**
   - Explore the [[../GovernancePatternLibrary|Governance Pattern Library]]
   - Identify patterns that address the context needs
   - Assess pattern compatibility with organizational culture

2.2. **Prioritize Patterns**
   - Evaluate patterns against adaptation goals
   - Prioritize based on impact, feasibility, and stakeholder support
   - Create a pattern implementation roadmap

2.3. **Pattern Combination Design**
   - Design how multiple patterns will work together
   - Identify potential conflicts or reinforcement between patterns
   - Develop an integrated pattern architecture

**Output:** Pattern Selection Matrix and Integration Design

### 3. Framework Customization (3-4 weeks)

3.1. **Adapt Core Patterns**
   - Modify selected patterns to fit the specific context
   - Ensure adaptations maintain essential fractal/scale-free characteristics
   - Document adaptations and their rationale

3.2. **Design Transition Approach**
   - Create a transition plan from current to adapted governance
   - Identify incremental implementation steps
   - Develop change management strategies

3.3. **Create Supporting Materials**
   - Develop documentation for the adapted framework
   - Create training materials for affected stakeholders
   - Design visual representations of the adapted governance structure

**Output:** Adapted Framework Documentation and Transition Plan

### 4. Validation (2-3 weeks)

4.1. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Present adapted framework to key stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on potential issues or concerns
   - Refine adaptations based on stakeholder input

4.2. **Simulation Testing**
   - Conduct scenario exercises using the adapted framework
   - Test decision-making processes with realistic examples
   - Identify potential failure modes and mitigations

4.3. **Pilot Planning**
   - Design limited-scope pilot implementation
   - Establish metrics and feedback mechanisms
   - Create pilot implementation timeline

**Output:** Validation Report and Pilot Implementation Plan

### 5. Implementation Support (Ongoing)

5.1. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Provide coaching to stakeholders implementing the adapted framework
   - Offer just-in-time training as needed
   - Create a support system for addressing questions and concerns

5.2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Gather structured feedback on implementation experience
   - Document emerging patterns and anti-patterns
   - Identify needed refinements to the adapted framework

5.3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Make iterative adjustments based on implementation feedback
   - Document lessons learned for future adaptations
   - Share insights with the broader Meta-Governance community

**Output:** Implementation Support Package and Feedback Reports

## Decision Points

1. **Context Assessment Approval**
   - Decision: Are the adaptation goals appropriate and aligned with organizational needs?
   - Decision Maker: Meta-Governance Director and key stakeholders
   - Criteria: Clarity, alignment with strategy, stakeholder support

2. **Pattern Selection Approval**
   - Decision: Is the selected pattern set appropriate for the context?
   - Decision Maker: Framework Adaptation Lead and Pattern Analyst
   - Criteria: Coverage of needs, coherence, feasibility

3. **Adaptation Approval**
   - Decision: Do the adaptations maintain essential characteristics while meeting context needs?
   - Decision Maker: Meta-Governance Steering Committee
   - Criteria: Principle integrity, contextual fit, stakeholder support

4. **Pilot Launch Approval**
   - Decision: Is the adapted framework ready for pilot implementation?
   - Decision Maker: Implementation Lead and affected stakeholders
   - Criteria: Documentation completeness, stakeholder readiness, risk assessment

5. **Full Implementation Approval**
   - Decision: Should the adapted framework move from pilot to full implementation?
   - Decision Maker: Meta-Governance Director and Executive Sponsor
   - Criteria: Pilot success, resource availability, organizational readiness

## Success Metrics

- **Adaptation Quality**: Degree to which adaptations maintain fractal/scale-free principles
- **Stakeholder Acceptance**: Level of stakeholder understanding and support for adapted framework
- **Implementation Progress**: Percentage of planned implementation milestones achieved
- **Governance Effectiveness**: Improvement in governance outcomes after implementation
- **Adaptation Efficiency**: Time and resources required for successful adaptation
