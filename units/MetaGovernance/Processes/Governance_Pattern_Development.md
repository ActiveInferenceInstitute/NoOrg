# Governance Pattern Development Process

## Purpose

This process guides the identification, documentation, validation, and integration of governance patterns into the [[../GovernancePatternLibrary|Governance Pattern Library]]. It ensures that patterns are thoroughly vetted, clearly documented, and effectively shared across the organization.

## Scope

This process applies to:
- Identification of potential new governance patterns
- Documentation of existing implicit or explicit patterns
- Validation of pattern effectiveness and transferability
- Integration of patterns into the Governance Pattern Library
- Evolution and refinement of existing patterns

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Pattern Originator** | Identifies and initially documents potential patterns; provides context and examples |
| **Pattern Analyst** | Reviews pattern documentation for completeness and clarity; assesses pattern effectiveness |
| **Pattern Reviewer** | Provides subject matter expertise to validate pattern; suggests refinements |
| **Pattern Library Curator** | Manages the overall library; ensures consistency; publishes approved patterns |
| **Implementation Coach** | Supports pattern application in new contexts; gathers implementation feedback |

## Process Flow

### 1. Pattern Identification (Ongoing)

1.1. **Recognition of Potential Patterns**
   - Identify recurring governance structures, processes or mechanisms
   - Observe effective governance practices across the organization
   - Research external governance approaches with potential applicability
   - Analyze pain points for which a pattern might be developed

1.2. **Initial Pattern Assessment**
   - Evaluate whether the observed practice constitutes a potential pattern
   - Determine if the practice is transferable to multiple contexts
   - Assess whether the practice addresses a significant governance need
   - Consider alignment with organizational values and principles

1.3. **Pattern Nomination**
   - Complete the [[../Templates/PatternNominationForm|Pattern Nomination Form]]
   - Submit to the Pattern Library Curator for initial review
   - Provide basic information about the pattern and its context

**Output:** Nominated Pattern Form

### 2. Pattern Documentation (2-4 weeks)

2.1. **Pattern Research**
   - Gather detailed information about the pattern in use
   - Interview practitioners who have applied the pattern
   - Research similar patterns in other organizations or literature
   - Identify key success factors and potential challenges

2.2. **Pattern Documentation**
   - Complete the [[../Templates/PatternDocumentationTemplate|Pattern Documentation Template]]
   - Include specific examples from multiple contexts if available
   - Document workflow, structure, and implementation steps
   - Identify complementary and alternative patterns

2.3. **Visual Representation**
   - Create diagrams illustrating the pattern structure
   - Develop flowcharts for pattern processes
   - Develop visualizations showing the pattern in context
   - Ensure visualizations enhance understanding of the pattern

**Output:** Draft Pattern Documentation

### 3. Pattern Validation (2-3 weeks)

3.1. **Expert Review**
   - Submit draft pattern documentation to subject matter experts
   - Invite review by practitioners familiar with the pattern
   - Solicit feedback from the Meta-Governance Steering Committee
   - Incorporate expert feedback into pattern documentation

3.2. **Theoretical Validation**
   - Assess alignment with established governance principles
   - Evaluate coherence with existing patterns in the library
   - Verify that the pattern addresses the stated problem
   - Check for potential conflicts with other governance mechanisms

3.3. **Practical Validation**
   - Test the pattern documentation with potential users
   - Ensure the documentation provides clear implementation guidance
   - Verify that the pattern can be adapted to different contexts
   - Confirm that the pattern creates the expected outcomes

**Output:** Validated Pattern Documentation

### 4. Pattern Integration (1-2 weeks)

4.1. **Final Documentation Review**
   - Conduct final editorial review of pattern documentation
   - Ensure all sections are complete and clear
   - Check for consistency in terminology and approach
   - Verify all references and links are accurate

4.2. **Classification and Tagging**
   - Assign the pattern to appropriate categories
   - Create metadata tags for searchability
   - Establish relationships with other patterns
   - Assign a unique pattern identifier

4.3. **Publication and Announcement**
   - Add the pattern to the Governance Pattern Library
   - Update indexes and references to include the new pattern
   - Announce the new pattern to relevant stakeholders
   - Create a summary for the pattern newsletter

**Output:** Published Pattern in Library

### 5. Pattern Evolution (Ongoing)

5.1. **Implementation Tracking**
   - Monitor pattern adoption across contexts
   - Gather feedback from implementation experiences
   - Document case studies of pattern application
   - Track adaptations made in different implementations

5.2. **Pattern Refinement**
   - Periodically review patterns for potential improvements
   - Update documentation based on implementation learnings
   - Refine visualizations to better illustrate the pattern
   - Expand examples and variations based on new applications

5.3. **Pattern Versioning**
   - Maintain version history of significant pattern changes
   - Document the rationale for major revisions
   - Communicate significant updates to pattern users
   - Deprecate patterns that are no longer effective

**Output:** Evolution Reports and Updated Pattern Documentation

## Decision Points

1. **Pattern Nomination Acceptance**
   - Decision: Is the nominated practice a potential pattern worth documenting?
   - Decision Maker: Pattern Library Curator
   - Criteria: Relevance, transferability, value, uniqueness

2. **Pattern Documentation Approval**
   - Decision: Is the pattern documentation complete and accurate?
   - Decision Maker: Pattern Analyst
   - Criteria: Comprehensiveness, clarity, actionability

3. **Pattern Validation Approval**
   - Decision: Has the pattern been sufficiently validated?
   - Decision Maker: Pattern Reviewer Panel
   - Criteria: Expert consensus, theoretical soundness, practical viability

4. **Pattern Publication Approval**
   - Decision: Is the pattern ready for inclusion in the library?
   - Decision Maker: Pattern Library Curator
   - Criteria: Documentation quality, validation completeness, library fit

5. **Pattern Revision or Deprecation**
   - Decision: Should a pattern be significantly revised or deprecated?
   - Decision Maker: Meta-Governance Steering Committee
   - Criteria: Pattern effectiveness, continued relevance, feedback analysis
