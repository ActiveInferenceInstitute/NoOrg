### Stage Descriptions

1.  **Lead Generation:** Identifying potential customers through various channels (marketing campaigns, referrals, cold outreach, etc.).
2.  **Lead Qualification:** Assessing leads against predefined criteria (e.g., BANT - Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) to determine if they are a good fit.
3.  **Opportunity Assessment:** Further evaluating qualified leads to understand the potential deal size, complexity, and likelihood of closing.
4.  **Needs Analysis:** Deeply understanding the prospect's challenges, requirements, and goals through discovery calls and meetings.
5.  **Proposal / Presentation:** Tailoring a solution and presenting a formal proposal or demonstration that addresses the prospect's needs.
6.  **Negotiation:** Discussing terms, pricing, and addressing any objections or concerns from the prospect.
7.  **Deal Closure / Won:** Obtaining formal agreement (e.g., signed contract) and marking the opportunity as closed-won.
8.  **Onboarding / Handover:** Transitioning the new customer to the relevant teams (e.g., [[CustomerSupport]], [[Implementation]]) for onboarding and service delivery.
9.  **Account Management:** Maintaining the customer relationship, identifying upsell/cross-sell opportunities, and ensuring customer satisfaction.
10. **Nurture / Disqualify:** Leads/Opportunities not ready to proceed are either disqualified or placed into nurturing campaigns for future engagement.
11. **Follow-up / Re-engage:** If negotiation stalls, establish follow-up steps or determine if re-engagement is appropriate later.
