*   **Scope:** The notice clearly defines the subject matter, time frame, and types of documents/ESI covered by the hold.
*   **Preservation Duty:** Custodians must suspend normal document destruction/deletion practices for relevant materials. This includes emails, documents, databases, social media, etc.
*   **IT Department Role:** Procedures for IT to preserve relevant ESI (e.g., suspending auto-deletion, collecting data).
*   **Acknowledgement:** Custodians must acknowledge receipt and understanding of the hold notice.
*   **Monitoring and Enforcement:** Procedures for ensuring compliance with the hold.
*   **Release:** The Legal Unit is responsible for formally releasing the hold when the litigation or threat has concluded.
