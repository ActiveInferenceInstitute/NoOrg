*   Data on company-issued devices (laptops, mobile phones)
*   Data on personal devices used for work (BYOD), if applicable and within scope
*   Hard copy documents, files, notes
*   Backup tapes and other storage media

## 3. Triggering Events

*   Government investigation or audit
*   Regulatory inquiry

*   Any other situation where the organization has a duty to preserve information for legal reasons.

## 4. Process Steps

1.  **Identification of Need:**
    *   Legal Department (or designated personnel) identifies a triggering event.
    *   Assess the nature of the matter and the potential scope of relevant information.
2.  **Scope Definition & Custodian Identification:**
    *   Define the relevant time frame, subject matter, and types of information likely to be involved.
    *   Identify key custodians â€“ individuals likely to possess relevant information.
    *   Identify relevant data sources (systems, applications, physical locations).
3.  **Issuance of Legal Hold Notice:**
    *   Draft a formal Legal Hold Notice using the approved [Legal Hold Notice Template Link].
    *   The notice must clearly state:
        *   The subject matter of the hold.
        *   The duty to preserve information.
        *   The types of information to be preserved.
        *   The relevant time period.
        *   Prohibition against deletion, modification, or disposal of relevant information.
        *   Instructions on suspending routine data destruction (e.g., auto-delete emails, shredding).
        *   Contact person for questions.
        *   Requirement for acknowledgment of receipt.
    *   Distribute the notice to all identified custodians and relevant IT personnel responsible for data systems.
    *   Utilize a system to track issuance and acknowledgments [Legal Hold Tracking Tool Link].
4.  **Custodian Interviews (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Conduct interviews with key custodians to better understand their data, storage practices, and potentially relevant information.
5.  **Preservation Actions (IT & Custodians):**
    *   **IT Department:**
        *   Suspend auto-deletion policies for relevant data sources and custodians.
        *   Ensure backup tapes covering the relevant period are secured and not overwritten.
        *   Implement preservation measures on relevant systems (e.g., email journaling, in-place holds in M365/Google Workspace).
        *   Secure relevant company-issued devices if necessary.
    *   **Custodians:**
        *   Segregate and protect relevant physical documents.
        *   Cease deletion of relevant electronic data under their control.
        *   Follow specific instructions provided in the Legal Hold Notice.
6.  **Data Collection (as needed):**

    *   Document the collection process thoroughly.
7.  **Monitoring & Reminders:**
    *   Periodically send reminder notices to custodians.
    *   Monitor compliance with the hold.
    *   Update the custodian list and data scope as the matter evolves (new custodians join/leave, scope changes).
8.  **Release of Legal Hold:**
    *   Once the legal matter is fully resolved and the duty to preserve no longer exists, the Legal Department will issue a formal Legal Hold Release Notice.
    *   Distribute the release notice to all custodians and IT personnel.
    *   Resume normal data retention and disposition schedules.
    *   Document the release.
