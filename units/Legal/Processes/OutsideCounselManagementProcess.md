# Outside Counsel Management Process

## 1. Purpose
To establish a consistent and efficient process for selecting, engaging, managing, and evaluating outside legal counsel to ensure high-quality legal services, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with the organization's objectives and values.

## 2. Scope
This process applies to all engagements of external law firms and individual attorneys (collectively referred to as "Outside Counsel") by any department or employee of the organization.

## 3. Process Steps

### 3.1. Identification of Need
- **Determine Need:** Internal teams identify the need for external legal expertise (e.g., specialized knowledge, litigation support, resource constraints).
- **Consultation with Legal Department:** The requesting department consults with the internal Legal Department to confirm the need and discuss potential counsel options.

### 3.2. Selection of Outside Counsel
- **Panel Review:** Review the organization's pre-approved panel of law firms, if applicable.
- **Request for Proposals (RFP):** For significant matters or if no suitable panel firm exists, issue an RFP to potential firms.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Evaluate proposals based on expertise, experience, staffing plan, diversity, references, cost structure, technology capabilities, and potential conflicts of interest.
- **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with shortlisted firms.
- **Selection & Approval:** The Legal Department, in consultation with the requesting business unit, selects the firm. Significant engagements may require higher-level approval (e.g., General Counsel, Executive Committee).

### 3.3. Engagement
- **Conflict Check:** Conduct a thorough conflict check before formal engagement.
- **Engagement Letter:** Draft and execute a formal engagement letter outlining the scope of work, fee arrangement (hourly, fixed fee, contingency, blended rate), billing guidelines, staffing, communication protocols, reporting requirements, and termination clauses.
- **Budgeting:** Establish a clear budget for the matter, including phase-based budgets where appropriate.

### 3.4. Matter Management
- **Case Strategy & Planning:** Collaborate with Outside Counsel on the matter strategy, key milestones, and expected outcomes.
- **Communication:** Maintain regular communication channels (e.g., scheduled calls, status reports). Define primary points of contact on both sides.
- **Budget Monitoring:** Regularly monitor fees and expenses against the budget. Require pre-approval for significant cost overruns or changes in scope.
- **Invoice Review:** Review invoices meticulously for compliance with billing guidelines, accuracy, and reasonableness. Address discrepancies promptly.
- **Performance Feedback:** Provide ongoing feedback to Outside Counsel regarding performance, responsiveness, and adherence to strategy.

### 3.5. Evaluation
- **Post-Matter Review:** Upon completion of a significant matter or annually for ongoing relationships, conduct a formal evaluation of Outside Counsel's performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess based on results achieved, quality of advice, responsiveness, communication, efficiency, budget adherence, and overall value.
- **Feedback to Counsel:** Share evaluation results with Outside Counsel.
- **Panel Updates:** Use evaluation results to inform decisions about future engagements and updates to the preferred provider panel.

### 3.6. Knowledge Management
- **Document Retention:** Ensure all key documents, work products, and communications are appropriately retained according to organizational policies.
- **Lessons Learned:** Capture key insights and lessons learned from the engagement for future reference.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
