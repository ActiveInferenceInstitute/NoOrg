# Policy Management Process

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** Head of Legal / Chief Compliance Officer
**Approval:** Executive Committee / Relevant Board Committee (e.g., Governance, Audit)

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the standardized process for the development, review, approval, communication, maintenance, and retirement of internal policies and procedures within [Organization Name]. The goal is to ensure policies are clear, consistent, current, compliant with applicable laws and regulations, and effectively communicated to relevant stakeholders.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all official organizational policies, standards, and procedures that govern conduct, operations, or decision-making across the organization or within specific units/departments. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Corporate Governance policies
*   Compliance policies
*   HR policies
*   IT Security policies
*   Financial policies
*   Operational procedures with policy implications

This process does *not* typically apply to informal guidelines or team-specific working practices unless they are intended to have organizational-level authority.

## 3. Process Steps

1.  **Policy Need Identification:**
    *   Identify the need for a new policy or the revision/retirement of an existing one based on regulatory changes, strategic initiatives, audit findings, risk assessments, operational changes, or employee feedback.
    *   The initiator (can be any unit/employee) drafts a brief proposal outlining the rationale and scope.
2.  **Proposal Review (Legal/Compliance/Policy Owner):**
    *   Relevant 'gatekeepers' (e.g., Legal, Compliance, designated Policy Office) review the proposal for necessity, potential overlap, and alignment with existing frameworks.
    *   Assign a 'Policy Owner' (typically the head of the unit most affected or responsible for the subject matter) and a 'Policy Drafter'.
3.  **Drafting:**
    *   The Policy Drafter develops the initial draft using the approved [Policy Template Link].
    *   Ensure clarity, conciseness, and actionable language.
    *   Consult with subject matter experts (SMEs) and key stakeholders.
4.  **Stakeholder Review & Feedback:**
    *   Circulate the draft policy to identified stakeholders (including Legal, Compliance, Risk, HR, IT, Finance, affected business units) for review and comment.
    *   Set a defined review period (e.g., 10 business days).
5.  **Feedback Incorporation & Finalization:**
    *   The Policy Drafter and Policy Owner review feedback, incorporate necessary revisions, and resolve conflicting comments.
    *   Ensure the final draft is reviewed by Legal and Compliance for legal sufficiency and regulatory alignment.
6.  **Approval:**
    *   The Policy Owner submits the final draft policy through the designated approval workflow.
    *   Approval levels depend on the policy's scope and impact (e.g., Unit Head, Executive Committee, Board Committee).
    *   Document approvals formally.
7.  **Communication & Training:**
    *   Publish the approved policy to the central [Policy Repository Link].
    *   Develop and execute a communication plan to inform affected employees.
    *   Develop and deliver training if necessary, tracking completion.
    *   Require acknowledgments where appropriate.
8.  **Implementation & Maintenance:**
    *   The Policy Owner is responsible for the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the policy.
    *   Schedule regular reviews (e.g., annually, biennially) or trigger reviews based on events (e.g., regulatory changes).
    *   Repeat steps 3-7 for any revisions.
9.  **Policy Retirement:**
    *   If a policy is no longer needed, the Policy Owner initiates the retirement process.
    *   Follow a defined approval process for retirement.
    *   Archive the retired policy according to the [Records Retention Policy Link].
    *   Communicate the retirement to stakeholders.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Policy Initiator:** Identifies the need for a policy and submits the initial proposal.
*   **Policy Owner:** Accountable for the policy content, accuracy, implementation, and lifecycle management (reviews, revisions, retirement). Usually a senior leader in the relevant functional area.

*   **Stakeholders/SMEs:** Provide input and feedback during the development and review process.
*   **Legal & Compliance:** Ensure legal/regulatory compliance, consistency, and risk mitigation.
*   **Approvers:** Authorize the policy based on defined approval levels (e.g., Executive Committee, Board Committee).
