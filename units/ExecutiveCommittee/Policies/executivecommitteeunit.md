- **Resource Allocation:** Overseeing budget management, making investment decisions, and ensuring optimal allocation of financial, human, and capital resources.
- **Risk & Compliance Management:** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating operational, financial, and strategic risks; ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies.
- **Organizational Development:** Fostering a high-performance culture, developing leadership capabilities, and overseeing talent management strategies (in coordination with HR).
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Managing communication with the Board, employees, and potentially key external stakeholders regarding operational performance and strategic execution.
