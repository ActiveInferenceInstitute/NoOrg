Key components may include:
- [[decision_making_principles]] (e.g., data-driven, strategic alignment, risk-based)
- [[decision_categorization_matrix]] (e.g., Type 1/Type 2 decisions, urgency levels)
- [[required_inputs_analysis_for_decisions]]
- [[stakeholder_consultation_matrix]] (Who needs input/informing)
- [[risk_assessment_in_decision_making]]
- [[criteria_for_escalation_to_board]]
- [[models_for_investment_prioritization]] (e.g., ROI, strategic value scorecards)
- [[ethical_considerations_checklist]]

This framework supports transparency, rigor, and alignment in executive decisions.
