# R&D Data Management Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for the management, storage, access, sharing, and preservation of research data generated or acquired during R&D activities to ensure data integrity, security, compliance, and usability.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all research data generated or used by R&D personnel, regardless of format (digital, physical) or storage location.

## 3. Definitions

-   **Research Data:** Recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings. This includes raw data, processed data, metadata, code, algorithms, lab notebooks, etc.
-   **Data Management Plan (DMP):** A formal document outlining how research data will be handled during and after a research project.

## 4. Data Management Planning

-   A Data Management Plan (DMP) is required for significant R&D projects, especially those funded externally or involving sensitive data.
-   The DMP should address data collection, documentation (metadata), storage, backup, security, access controls, sharing, and long-term preservation.

## 5. Data Collection and Documentation

-   Data should be collected using appropriate methods and instruments.
-   All data must be accurately and contemporaneously documented, including experimental conditions, procedures, and metadata necessary to interpret the data.
-   Standardized formats and nomenclature should be used where possible.
-   Laboratory notebooks (physical or electronic) must be maintained diligently.

## 6. Data Storage and Security

-   Data must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access, modification, loss, or theft.
-   Use designated organizational storage solutions (servers, cloud storage) whenever possible.
-   Regular backups of digital data are mandatory.
-   Physical data (samples, notebooks) must be stored securely.
-   Appropriate security measures (encryption, access controls) must be implemented, especially for sensitive or confidential data.

## 7. Data Access and Sharing

-   Access to research data should be managed according to project needs, confidentiality requirements, and organizational policies.
-   Data sharing (internally or externally) should comply with ethical guidelines, funding requirements, collaboration agreements, and IP policies.
-   Consider using data repositories for sharing published data.

## 8. Data Retention and Preservation

-   Research data must be retained for a minimum period defined by organizational policy, funding agency requirements, regulatory mandates, or journal policies (whichever is longest).
-   Develop strategies for long-term preservation of valuable data, including format migration if necessary.
-   Procedures for data disposal at the end of the retention period must be followed.

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Researchers:** Responsible for implementing data management practices according to their DMP and this policy.
-   **Principal Investigators/Supervisors:** Oversee data management within their projects/teams.
-   **IT Department:** Provides and supports secure storage infrastructure.
-   **Data Stewards/Committee:** Provide guidance and oversight on data management practices.

## 10. Compliance

Adherence to this policy is essential for research integrity and compliance. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action.
