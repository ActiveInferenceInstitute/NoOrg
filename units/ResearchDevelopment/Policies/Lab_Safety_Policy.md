# R&D Laboratory Safety Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes safety standards, procedures, and responsibilities to protect personnel, the environment, and facilities from hazards associated with laboratory work within the Research & Development (R&D) Unit.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all personnel (employees, contractors, students, visitors) working in or entering R&D laboratory spaces and covers all activities involving potentially hazardous materials, equipment, or procedures.

## 3. General Safety Principles

-   Safety is a shared responsibility. Everyone is expected to prioritize safety in all lab activities.
-   Know the potential hazards associated with your work, including chemical, biological, physical, and radiological hazards.
-   Follow all established safety procedures and protocols.
-   Use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as required.
-   Maintain good housekeeping in laboratory areas.
-   Report all accidents, incidents, near misses, and unsafe conditions immediately to your supervisor and the designated safety officer.
-   Be familiar with emergency procedures, including evacuation routes, emergency contacts, and locations of safety equipment (fire extinguishers, safety showers, eyewash stations, first aid kits).
-   Eating, drinking, smoking, and applying cosmetics are prohibited in laboratory work areas.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Management:** Provide resources for safety, ensure policy enforcement, and promote a strong safety culture.
-   **Safety Officer/Committee:** Develop and oversee the safety program, conduct inspections, provide training, investigate incidents, and maintain safety records.
-   **Supervisors/Principal Investigators:** Ensure personnel are trained, enforce safety rules within their labs, conduct risk assessments, and approve specific hazardous procedures.
-   **Laboratory Personnel:** Follow safety procedures, use PPE, report hazards, participate in training, and maintain a safe work environment.

## 5. Hazard Communication

-   All hazardous materials must be properly labeled according to regulatory standards (e.g., GHS).
-   Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for all hazardous chemicals must be readily accessible.
-   Personnel must be trained on understanding labels and SDSs and the hazards of the materials they work with.

## 6. Chemical Safety

-   Handle chemicals appropriately based on their hazards.
-   Store chemicals properly, segregated by compatibility.
-   Use fume hoods or other ventilation controls when working with volatile or toxic substances.
-   Follow established procedures for chemical waste disposal.

## 7. Biological Safety (if applicable)

-   Follow biosafety level (BSL) requirements appropriate for the biological agents being handled.
-   Use biological safety cabinets (BSCs) as required.
-   Follow procedures for handling, storing, and disposing of biohazardous materials and waste.
-   Implement appropriate decontamination procedures.

## 8. Physical Hazards

-   Use machine guards and follow safe operating procedures for equipment.
-   Be aware of electrical hazards; ensure equipment is properly grounded and maintained.
-   Take precautions against ergonomic hazards.
-   Follow procedures for handling compressed gases, cryogenics, high/low temperatures, and high pressures.

## 9. Radiological Safety (if applicable)

-   Adhere to all regulations and institutional policies regarding the use, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials.
-   Follow ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principles.
-   Use appropriate shielding and monitoring devices.

## 10. Waste Disposal

-   Dispose of all waste (chemical, biological, sharps, radiological, general) according to established institutional and regulatory procedures.
-   Waste containers must be properly labeled.

## 11. Training

-   All personnel must complete mandatory general laboratory safety training before starting work.
-   Specific training is required for particular hazards (e.g., chemical, biological, radiological) relevant to an individual's work.
-   Training records must be maintained.

## 12. Inspections and Audits

-   Regular safety inspections of laboratory areas will be conducted.
-   Findings must be addressed promptly.

## 13. Emergency Preparedness

-   Know the specific emergency response plan for your laboratory and building.
-   Participate in emergency drills.

## 14. Compliance

Failure to comply with this safety policy may result in disciplinary action, including removal from laboratory work and up to termination.

## 15. Contact

For safety-related questions or concerns, contact your Supervisor or the [Designated Safety Officer/Environmental Health & Safety Department].
