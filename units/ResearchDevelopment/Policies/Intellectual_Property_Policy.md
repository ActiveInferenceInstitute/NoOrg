# R&D Intellectual Property (IP) Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the principles and procedures governing the identification, protection, management, and commercialization of Intellectual Property (IP) generated through Research & Development (R&D) activities conducted by or for the organization.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all individuals involved in R&D activities, including employees, contractors, consultants, students, and collaborators, and covers all forms of IP generated within the scope of their work for the organization.

## 3. Definitions

-   **Intellectual Property (IP):** Creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; symbols, names, and images used in commerce. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, industrial designs, and know-how.
-   **Invention Disclosure:** A confidential document submitted by inventors describing a potentially patentable invention.

## 4. Ownership of IP

-   Generally, all IP created by employees within the scope of their employment or using organizational resources belongs to the organization.
-   Ownership terms for IP generated by contractors, consultants, or collaborators will be defined in specific agreements.
-   Exceptions may apply based on prior agreements or specific funding requirements, subject to review and approval.

## 5. Identification and Disclosure

-   Individuals have a responsibility to promptly identify and disclose potentially valuable IP (especially inventions) to the designated IP management function or committee (e.g., Technology Transfer Office, Legal Department).
-   Invention disclosures should be submitted using the standard organizational form, providing sufficient detail for evaluation.
-   Maintain confidentiality regarding potential IP until a protection strategy is determined.

## 6. Protection Strategy

-   The organization, through its designated IP function, will evaluate disclosed IP for potential protection (e.g., patenting, copyright registration, trade secret maintenance).
-   Decisions on whether and how to protect IP will consider factors such as commercial potential, strategic value, cost, and likelihood of success.
-   Researchers must cooperate fully in the protection process (e.g., providing information for patent applications).

## 7. Management and Commercialization

-   The organization will manage its IP portfolio to maximize value.
-   This may include licensing IP to third parties, using IP in products/services, contributing to standards, or forming spin-out companies.
-   Decisions regarding commercialization will be made by the designated IP management function in consultation with relevant stakeholders.

## 8. Revenue Sharing

-   If IP is successfully commercialized and generates revenue, a portion may be shared with the inventors/creators according to a separate, pre-defined revenue-sharing policy.

## 9. Confidentiality and Publication

-   Researchers must balance the need for publication and academic dissemination with the need to protect potential IP.
-   Public disclosure (publication, presentation) before filing for patent protection can jeopardize patent rights. Consult the IP management function before public disclosure of potentially patentable inventions.
-   Confidential information related to R&D and IP must be handled according to organizational confidentiality policies.

## 10. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Inventors/Creators:** Identify and disclose IP, cooperate in protection and commercialization efforts.
-   **IP Management Function:** Evaluate disclosures, manage protection processes, oversee portfolio, lead commercialization efforts.
-   **Legal Department:** Provides legal counsel on IP matters.
-   **Management:** Ensures awareness and compliance with the IP policy.

## 11. Compliance

Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Unauthorized use or disclosure of organizational IP may result in disciplinary action and legal consequences.
