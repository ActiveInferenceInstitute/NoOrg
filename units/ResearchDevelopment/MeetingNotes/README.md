# R&D Meeting Notes

This directory is intended for storing minutes, agendas, and action items from meetings relevant to the Research & Development Unit.

Suggestions for organization:
-   Create subdirectories for recurring meetings (e.g., `Weekly_Team_Sync/`, `Project_X_Meetings/`).
-   Use a consistent naming convention for files (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_Meeting_Topic.md`).
-   Consider using a standard meeting minutes template.
