# R&D Experiment Design Process

## 1. Purpose

To ensure that experiments conducted within R&D are well-planned, statistically sound, methodologically rigorous, and documented appropriately to produce valid, reliable, and reproducible results.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all experimental work conducted as part of approved R&D projects, from initial planning to final documentation.

## 3. Process Steps

1.  **Define Objectives & Hypotheses:** Clearly state the specific question(s) the experiment aims to answer and formulate testable hypotheses based on the project goals and prior knowledge.
2.  **Identify Variables:**
    *   **Independent Variables:** Factors that will be manipulated or changed.
    *   **Dependent Variables:** Factors that will be measured to determine the effect of the independent variables.
    *   **Controlled Variables:** Factors kept constant to avoid influencing the outcome.
3.  **Select Experimental Design:** Choose an appropriate experimental design based on the objectives, variables, and resources (e.g., Factorial, Randomized Block, Repeated Measures, Control Group design).
    *   Consider statistical power, sample size, and randomization needs.
4.  **Determine Measurement Procedures:** Define precisely how dependent variables will be measured, including instruments, units, and protocols. Ensure measurement tools are calibrated and reliable.
5.  **Develop Protocol/Procedure:** Write a detailed, step-by-step protocol for conducting the experiment. Include:
    *   Materials and equipment list.
    *   Preparation steps.
    *   Exact procedure for manipulating independent variables and measuring dependent variables.
    *   Data recording methods.
    *   Safety precautions (linking to Lab Safety Policy and specific risk assessments).
6.  **Plan Data Analysis:** Determine the statistical methods that will be used to analyze the data *before* conducting the experiment. This helps ensure the experimental design yields data suitable for the chosen analysis.
7.  **Conduct Pilot Study (Optional but Recommended):** Perform a small-scale preliminary run to test the feasibility of the protocol, identify potential issues, and refine procedures or sample size calculations.
8.  **Peer Review of Design (Recommended):** Have the experimental design and protocol reviewed by colleagues or subject matter experts for feedback on soundness and clarity.
9.  **Finalize Design & Protocol:** Incorporate feedback and finalize the experimental plan.
10. **Execute Experiment:** Conduct the experiment according to the finalized protocol, carefully documenting all steps, observations, and any deviations.
11. **Record Data:** Record data accurately and systematically using predefined formats (e.g., lab notebooks, spreadsheets, databases) according to the Data Management Policy.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Researcher/Scientist:** Primarily responsible for designing, planning, executing, and documenting the experiment.
-   **Supervisor/Principal Investigator:** Oversees the design process, provides guidance, ensures adherence to policies, and approves the final design.
-   **Statistician (if applicable):** Provides expert advice on experimental design, sample size, and data analysis planning.
-   **Peers/Reviewers:** Provide constructive feedback on the proposed design and protocol.
-   **Safety Officer:** Consulted for risk assessment and safety procedures.

## 6. Tools and Templates

## 7. Review

This process should be reviewed and updated periodically to incorporate best practices in experimental design.
