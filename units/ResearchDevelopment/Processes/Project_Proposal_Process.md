# R&D Project Proposal Process

## 1. Purpose

To provide a standardized framework for developing, submitting, reviewing, and approving proposals for Research & Development projects, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives, technical feasibility, and resource availability.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all R&D projects originating from the Idea Generation process or other approved channels that require significant resource allocation (budget, personnel, time).

## 3. Process Steps

1.  **Proposal Development:** The project initiator/team (often stemming from an approved idea) develops a detailed project proposal.
    *   **Content:** Project goals & objectives, background & rationale, scope & deliverables, technical approach & methodology, work plan & timeline, resource requirements (budget, personnel, equipment), risk assessment & mitigation plan, success metrics, IP considerations, team members & roles.
2.  **Internal Review (Optional but Recommended):** The proposal undergoes an informal review within the R&D team or by relevant subject matter experts for feedback and refinement before formal submission.
3.  **Formal Submission:** The finalized proposal is submitted to the designated R&D governance body (e.g., R&D Committee, Management).
4.  **Proposal Review:** The governance body reviews the proposal based on criteria such as:
    *   Strategic alignment.
    *   Technical merit and feasibility.
    *   Commercial potential / Value proposition.
    *   Budget and resource justification.
    *   Risk level and mitigation adequacy.
    *   Team capability.
    *   Completeness and clarity of the proposal.
5.  **Review Meeting:** The governance body meets to discuss the proposal. The project initiator/team may be required to present the proposal and answer questions.
6.  **Decision:** The governance body makes a decision:
    *   **Approve:** The project is approved for initiation. Resources are allocated (or allocation process begins).
    *   **Approve with Modifications:** The project is approved conditional on specific changes being made to the proposal.
    *   **Request Revision:** More information or significant revisions are required. The proposal is sent back to the initiator for rework and resubmission.
    *   **Reject:** The project is not approved. Clear justification is provided to the initiator.
7.  **Notification & Documentation:** The decision is formally communicated to the project initiator/team and relevant stakeholders. Approved proposals are archived, and project initiation procedures commence.
