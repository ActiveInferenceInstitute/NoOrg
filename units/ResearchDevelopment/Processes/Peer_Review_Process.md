# R&D Peer Review Process

## 1. Purpose

To establish a formal process for the critical evaluation of R&D work (e.g., research proposals, experimental designs, manuscripts, reports, code) by qualified peers, ensuring quality, rigor, validity, and adherence to scientific and ethical standards before progression, publication, or implementation.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to designated R&D outputs requiring formal peer review as determined by project milestones, publication requirements, or internal quality standards.

## 3. Principles of Peer Review

-   **Expertise:** Reviewers should possess relevant knowledge and expertise.
-   **Objectivity:** Reviewers must evaluate the work fairly and without bias (personal, professional, or financial).
-   **Confidentiality:** The content of the work under review and the review process itself are confidential.
-   **Constructiveness:** Reviews should provide clear, constructive feedback aimed at improving the work.
-   **Timeliness:** Reviews should be completed within a reasonable timeframe.

## 4. Process Steps

1.  **Identify Need for Review:** The author/team or R&D management identifies that a work product requires peer review.
2.  **Select Review Coordinator:** A neutral coordinator (e.g., supervisor, project manager, committee chair) is assigned to manage the review process.
3.  **Prepare Submission Package:** The author prepares the work product along with any necessary context (e.g., background information, specific questions for reviewers).
4.  **Select Reviewers:** The coordinator selects appropriate peer reviewers (typically 2-3) based on expertise and ensuring no conflicts of interest.
    *   Reviewers can be internal or external, depending on the nature of the work and required expertise.
    *   Potential reviewers are invited and confirm their availability and lack of conflicts.
5.  **Distribute Materials:** The coordinator distributes the submission package and review guidelines/criteria to the confirmed reviewers, specifying the deadline.
6.  **Conduct Review:** Reviewers critically evaluate the work based on provided criteria (e.g., scientific rigor, methodology, clarity, originality, validity of conclusions, ethical considerations).
7.  **Submit Reviews:** Reviewers submit their confidential reviews (often including comments and a recommendation - e.g., Accept, Minor Revisions, Major Revisions, Reject) to the coordinator by the deadline.
8.  **Synthesize Feedback:** The coordinator compiles and synthesizes the anonymous reviews, removing any identifying information about the reviewers.
9.  **Communicate Feedback to Author:** The coordinator shares the synthesized, anonymous feedback and the overall recommendation with the author/team.
10. **Author Response & Revision:** The author/team addresses the reviewers' comments and revises the work product accordingly. A response document detailing how each comment was addressed may be required.
11. **Review of Revisions (if necessary):** If major revisions were required, the coordinator may send the revised work and author responses back to the original reviewers (or new reviewers) for a second round of review.
12. **Final Decision:** Based on the reviews and author responses, the coordinator (or relevant decision-making body) makes a final decision on the status of the work product (e.g., approved for publication, proceed to next project phase).
13. **Documentation:** The review process, feedback, responses, and final decision are documented and archived.
