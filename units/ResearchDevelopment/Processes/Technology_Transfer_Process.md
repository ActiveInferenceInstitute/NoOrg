# R&D Technology Transfer Process

## 1. Purpose

To define the process for identifying, evaluating, protecting, and transferring technologies and intellectual property (IP) developed within the R&D Unit to internal business units or external parties for further development, commercialization, or broader use, maximizing the value derived from R&D investments.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all technologies, inventions, software, data, know-how, and other forms of IP generated through R&D activities that have potential for internal application or external commercialization.

## 3. Process Steps

1.  **IP Identification & Disclosure:** Researchers identify potential IP arising from their work and submit a formal Invention Disclosure (or equivalent for other IP types like software) as per the [[Intellectual_Property_Policy.md]].
2.  **Initial Assessment (Triage):** The designated IP/Technology Transfer function (e.g., TTO, IP Committee) performs an initial assessment of the disclosure based on:
    *   Clarity and completeness.
    *   Potential novelty and inventiveness.
    *   Apparent alignment with organizational strategy or market needs.
    *   *Outcome:* Proceed to detailed evaluation or provide feedback/request more info.
3.  **Detailed Evaluation:** A comprehensive evaluation is conducted, potentially involving technical experts, market analysts, and legal counsel.
    *   **Technical Assessment:** Feasibility, stage of development, potential applications.
    *   **Market Assessment:** Market size, competition, potential partners/licensees, commercial viability.
    *   **IP Assessment:** Patentability/protectability, freedom-to-operate, existing IP landscape.
    *   **Strategic Fit:** Alignment with business unit needs or commercialization goals.
4.  **Protection Strategy:** Based on the evaluation, a decision is made on whether and how to protect the IP (patent, trade secret, copyright, etc.), following the [[Intellectual_Property_Policy.md]]. This often occurs in parallel with market assessment.
5.  **Marketing & Partner Identification:** If external transfer is pursued, the IP/Tech Transfer function actively markets the technology to potential licensees or partners. This may involve creating non-confidential summaries, attending industry events, and direct outreach.
6.  **Internal Transfer Identification:** Identify potential internal business units that could benefit from or further develop the technology.
7.  **Negotiation & Agreement:**
    *   **External:** Negotiate terms for licensing agreements, sponsored research agreements, material transfer agreements (MTAs), or spin-out formation with external parties. Requires legal review.
    *   **Internal:** Define terms for transfer to internal business units, including support, knowledge transfer, and potential cross-charging.
8.  **Agreement Execution:** Formalize the transfer through legally binding agreements (external) or internal MOUs/transfer plans.
9.  **Knowledge & Technology Transfer:** Facilitate the transfer of necessary know-how, documentation, materials, and potentially personnel support to the receiving party (internal or external).
10. **Post-Transfer Management & Monitoring:**
    *   **External:** Manage the ongoing relationship with licensees/partners, monitor compliance with agreement terms (e.g., diligence, royalties), and manage IP maintenance (e.g., patent fees).
    *   **Internal:** Track the adoption and impact of the transferred technology within the organization.
11. **Revenue Distribution (if applicable):** Distribute any financial returns according to the organization's revenue-sharing policy.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Researchers/Inventors:** Identify and disclose IP, cooperate in evaluation, protection, and transfer activities.
-   **IP/Technology Transfer Function (TTO):** Manages the entire process, conducts assessments, develops strategies, markets IP, negotiates agreements, monitors compliance.
-   **Legal Counsel:** Advises on IP protection, drafts/reviews agreements.
-   **Business Development/Commercialization Team:** Provides market insights, identifies partners, supports negotiation.
-   **Business Unit Managers (Internal):** Evaluate potential internal applications, champion internal adoption.
-   **R&D Management/Governance Committee:** Provides oversight, makes strategic decisions on protection and transfer paths.
