# Service Level Agreements

This document defines the standard Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for customer support operations, establishing clear expectations for response and resolution times across different support tiers and issue severities.

## Purpose

These SLAs ensure consistent, high-quality support experiences by establishing measurable standards for support performance that align with customer expectations and business requirements.

## Support Tiers

| Tier 2 | Specialized technical support for complex issues | Mon-Fri, 8am-8pm | Email, Phone, Ticket Escalation |
| Tier 3 | Advanced product specialists and development support | Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm | Internal Escalation Only |
| Enterprise | Dedicated support for enterprise customers | 24/7/365 | Dedicated Line, Email, Portal |

## Response Time SLAs

| Severity | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Enterprise |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Critical | 15 min | 30 min | 1 hour | 15 min |
| High | 1 hour | 2 hours | 4 hours | 30 min |
| Medium | 4 hours | 8 hours | 24 hours | 2 hours |
| Low | 24 hours | 48 hours | 72 hours | 8 hours |

## Resolution Time SLAs

| Severity | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Enterprise |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Critical | 2 hours | 4 hours | 8 hours | 1 hour |
| High | 8 hours | 24 hours | 48 hours | 4 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours | 72 hours | 5 days | 12 hours |
| Low | 5 days | 10 days | 15 days | 48 hours |

## Severity Definitions

### Critical
- System-wide outage
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach
- Complete loss of core functionality

### High
- Significant degradation of service
- Important feature unavailable
- Performance issues affecting multiple users
- Workaround available but limited

### Medium
- Minor feature unavailability
- Non-critical bugs
- Single user issues
- Viable workaround available

### Low
- Cosmetic issues
- Feature requests
- Documentation issues
- General inquiries

## SLA Measurement

- **Response Time**: Time between ticket creation and first meaningful response from support
- **Resolution Time**: Time between ticket creation and complete resolution
- **Business Hours**: SLAs are calculated based on support tier business hours
- **Paused Time**: Time waiting for customer response is excluded from SLA calculations

## Escalation Procedures

When SLAs are at risk of breach, the following escalation procedure is initiated:

1. **75% of SLA time elapsed**: Notification to support team lead
2. **90% of SLA time elapsed**: Escalation to support manager
3. **SLA breached**: Escalation to customer support director and notification to customer

For complete escalation procedures, refer to [[../Processes/EscalationProcedures|Escalation Procedures]].
