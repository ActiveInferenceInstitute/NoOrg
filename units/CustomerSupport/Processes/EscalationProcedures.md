## Escalation Types

### 1. Technical Escalation
- **Definition**: Issues requiring specialized technical knowledge or system access
- **Examples**: Complex technical bugs, integration issues, security concerns
- **Escalation Path**: Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Development
- **Primary Contact**: Technical Support Team Lead

### 2. Procedural Escalation
- **Definition**: Issues requiring special handling procedures or policy exceptions
