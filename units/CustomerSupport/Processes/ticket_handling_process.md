# Customer Support Ticket Handling Process

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the standard process for receiving, managing, resolving, and closing customer support requests (tickets) across all channels.

## 2. Scope
This process applies to all support requests logged in the organization's ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk, Jira Service Management, Salesforce Service Cloud) handled by the Customer Support Unit.

## 3. Process Steps
1.  **Ticket Creation:**
    *   Tickets are created automatically (email, web form) or manually by agents (phone, chat, social media).
    *   Ensure essential information is captured: customer contact, clear description of the issue, product/service involved, channel.
2.  **Triage & Categorization:**
    *   Review the incoming ticket queue.
    *   Assign appropriate category (e.g., Bug Report, How-To Question, Feature Request, Billing Issue).
    *   Set initial priority based on defined criteria (e.g., customer impact, urgency, SLA tier). ([See: [[sla_policy.md]]])
3.  **Assignment:**
    *   Assign the ticket to the appropriate support agent or queue based on skills, availability, or predefined rules.
4.  **Initial Response:**
    *   Acknowledge receipt of the ticket within the SLA target. ([See: [[sla_policy.md]]])
    *   If possible, provide an initial assessment or request clarifying information.
    *   Communicate expected next steps or timeframe (if known).
5.  **Investigation & Diagnosis:**
    *   Gather necessary information (logs, screenshots, steps to reproduce).
    *   Utilize knowledge base and internal resources.
    *   Reproduce the issue if applicable.
    *   Communicate progress to the customer periodically, especially if investigation takes time.
6.  **Resolution:**
    *   Provide a solution, workaround, or answer to the customer's query.
    *   If escalation is needed, follow the [[escalation_process.md]].
    *   If it's a feature request or bug requiring development, log it accordingly and inform the customer of the process.
7.  **Confirmation & Closure:**
    *   Confirm with the customer that the issue is resolved to their satisfaction (or that the provided information answers their query).
    *   Allow a reasonable time for customer response before proactively closing (e.g., 48-72 hours).
    *   Update the ticket with resolution details, ensuring accurate categorization and tagging for reporting.
    *   Close the ticket in the system.
8.  **Post-Closure (Optional):**
    *   Trigger CSAT survey.
    *   Identify opportunities for new knowledge base articles based on the resolution.
