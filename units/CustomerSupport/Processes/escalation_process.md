# Customer Support Escalation Process

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the process for escalating customer support tickets that cannot be resolved by the initial support tier or require specialized knowledge, authority, or cross-departmental collaboration.

## 2. Scope
This process applies to all tickets within the Customer Support Unit requiring escalation, either internally to higher tiers/specialists or externally to other departments (e.g., Development, Product, Billing, Operations).

## 3. Escalation Triggers
Tickets should be escalated when:
- The assigned agent lacks the technical expertise or knowledge to resolve the issue.
- The issue requires access or permissions the agent does not have.
- The issue involves a confirmed bug requiring development intervention.
- The issue requires policy exceptions or decisions beyond the agent's authority.
- A customer specifically requests escalation (after initial troubleshooting attempts).
- The issue is nearing or has breached its SLA resolution target without significant progress. ([See: [[sla_policy.md]]])
- The issue requires coordination with another department.
- The issue represents a critical system outage or widespread problem.

## 4. Process Steps

### 4.1. Internal Escalation (e.g., Tier 1 to Tier 2/Specialist)
1.  **Identify Need:** Agent identifies an escalation trigger.
2.  **Prepare Escalation:** Agent thoroughly documents troubleshooting steps taken, current issue status, reason for escalation, and specific questions for the next tier. Ensure all relevant logs/data are attached.
3.  **Escalate Ticket:** Agent uses the ticketing system to reassign the ticket to the appropriate higher-tier queue or specialist.
4.  **Notify (if necessary):** For urgent issues, agent may notify the receiving team/specialist via internal chat/communication channels.
5.  **Acceptance & Ownership:** Higher tier accepts the ticket, acknowledges receipt (internally), and takes ownership.
6.  **Resolution:** Higher tier works towards resolution, potentially collaborating with the original agent or customer.
7.  **Communication:** Higher tier updates the ticket and communicates with the customer (or advises Tier 1 to do so).

### 4.2. External Escalation (e.g., Support to Development/Product/Billing)
1.  **Identify Need:** Agent/Support Lead identifies the need for another department's involvement (e.g., bug fix, policy clarification, feature request handling).
2.  **Prepare Escalation:** Agent/Lead summarizes the issue, customer impact, support findings, and specific action/information needed from the other department. Create a separate bug ticket or internal task if required by that department's process.
3.  **Initiate Contact:** Use agreed-upon channels (e.g., specific Jira project, shared Slack channel, email alias) to formally request assistance from the target department, linking the original support ticket.
4.  **Track Progress:** Support maintains visibility on the external request and updates the customer ticket periodically on the status.
5.  **Receive Resolution/Information:** Once the other department provides a fix, information, or decision, update the customer ticket.
6.  **Close Customer Ticket:** Proceed with customer communication and ticket closure as per [[ticket_handling_process.md]].

## 5. Inputs
- Unresolved/Complex Support Ticket
- Documented troubleshooting steps
- Escalation criteria ([See: [[escalation_policy.md]]])
- Target department contact points/procedures

## 6. Outputs
- Escalated Ticket (reassigned or linked)
- Resolution provided by higher tier or other department
- Updated customer communication

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Support Agents (All Tiers):** Identify escalation needs, prepare tickets for escalation, manage communication.
- **Support Leads/Managers:** Handle complex escalations, liaise with other departments, monitor escalated ticket queues.
- **Specialists/Higher Tiers:** Accept and resolve internal escalations.
- **Other Departments (Development, Product, etc.):** Respond to and act upon external escalations according to their procedures.

## 8. Tools
- Ticketing System
- Internal Communication Tools (Chat, Email)
- Bug Tracking System (e.g., Jira)
- Knowledge Base

## 9. Metrics
- Escalation Rate (% of tickets escalated)
- Time spent at each escalation level
- Resolution time for escalated tickets
- Inter-departmental response time
