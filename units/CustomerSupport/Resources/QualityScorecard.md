# Quality Scorecard

This document provides the standardized evaluation criteria used to assess the quality of customer support interactions across all channels. It defines the specific elements measured, scoring methodology, and quality standards.

## Purpose

The Quality Scorecard establishes objective, consistent criteria for evaluating customer support interactions. It aligns quality assessment with customer expectations, business objectives, and support standards to ensure exceptional service delivery and identify improvement opportunities.

## Using the Scorecard

1. Review the complete customer interaction from start to finish
2. Assess each dimension according to the defined criteria
3. Assign a score from 1-5 for each element
4. Add comments to justify scores and provide specific feedback
5. Calculate the overall quality score
6. Share results with the agent and develop improvement plans as needed

## Scoring Methodology

### Score Calculation
1. Each dimension receives a score from 1-5
2. Score is multiplied by the dimension weight
3. Weighted scores are summed for the overall quality score

**Example**:
- Technical Accuracy: 4 × 25% = 1.00
- Customer Experience: 5 × 25% = 1.25
- Process Adherence: 3 × 20% = 0.60
- Communication: 4 × 20% = 0.80
- Efficiency: 4 × 10% = 0.40
- **Overall Score**: 4.05 out of 5.00 (81%)

### Performance Levels

| Score Range | Performance Level | Action |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| 4.5-5.0 | Exceptional | Recognition, potential mentor role |
| 4.0-4.49 | Strong | Positive feedback, targeted enhancement |
| 3.5-3.99 | Satisfactory | Routine coaching, specific improvement areas |
| 3.0-3.49 | Needs Improvement | Performance improvement plan, increased monitoring |
| <3.0 | Unsatisfactory | Immediate intervention, intensive coaching |
