## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Capacity Planning**: Adjust staffing for peak SLA breach times (12pm and 4-5pm)
2. **Targeted Training**: Technical support team proficiency in API Integration issues
3. **Process Improvement**: Review and optimize third-party escalation workflows
4. **Knowledge Gap Closure**: Create additional resources for top breach categories
5. **Tool Enhancement**: Implement SLA warning system at 75% of time threshold
