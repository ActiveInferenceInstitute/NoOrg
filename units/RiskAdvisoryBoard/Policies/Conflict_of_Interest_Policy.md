# Risk Advisory Board (RAB) Conflict of Interest Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for identifying, disclosing, and managing actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest involving members of the Risk Advisory Board (RAB). Adherence to this policy is essential to maintaining the integrity, independence, and objectivity of the RAB's advisory role.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all members of the Risk Advisory Board.

## 3. Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest exists when a RAB member's personal interests (financial, professional, or otherwise) or the interests of a related party could potentially interfere, or appear to interfere, with the member's ability to exercise objective judgment in fulfilling their duties to the RAB.

**Key Terms:**
- **Related Party**: Includes immediate family members (spouse, domestic partner, parents, children, siblings), dependents, and any entity in which the member or an immediate family member has a significant financial interest or holds a position of control (e.g., director, officer, partner).
- **Significant Financial Interest**: [Define threshold based on organizational policy, e.g., Ownership of more than 1% of the equity; compensation exceeding $X annually; indebtedness exceeding $Y]. This definition should align with broader organizational conflict of interest policies.

Examples include, but are not limited to:
- A significant financial interest (e.g., ownership, investment) in a company that is a major competitor, supplier, or partner of the organization.
- A consulting, employment, or directorship role with an entity whose interests may conflict with the organization's.
- Receiving gifts, favors, or hospitality beyond nominal value from parties that interact with the organization.
- Personal or family relationships that could compromise objectivity.
- Using confidential information obtained through RAB participation for personal gain or the benefit of a third party.

## 4. Disclosure Requirements

- **Initial Disclosure**: Upon appointment, each RAB member must complete and sign a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form (See Appendix X - Template Form), detailing any known actual, potential, or perceived conflicts.
- **Annual Re-certification**: Members must review, update if necessary, and re-sign the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form annually.
- **Ongoing Disclosure**: Members have a continuous obligation to disclose any new conflicts of interest as soon as they arise, updating their form and informing the Chair/Secretary.
- **Meeting-Specific Disclosure**: At the beginning of each RAB meeting, members should verbally declare if any agenda items present a conflict of interest for them, even if previously disclosed.
- **Reporting**: Disclosures should be made to the RAB Chair and the designated Secretary or management liaison.

## 5. Management of Conflicts

Upon disclosure of a conflict of interest, the RAB Chair, in consultation with [Specify relevant party, e.g., Legal Counsel, Ethics Officer, designated management liaison], will determine the appropriate course of action, which may include:
- **Recusal**: The member may be required to recuse themselves from discussions and any related recommendations pertaining to the matter involving the conflict.
- **Information Restriction**: Access to specific confidential information related to the conflict may be restricted.
- **Monitoring**: The situation may be monitored to ensure objectivity is maintained.
- **Resignation**: In cases of significant and unmanageable conflict, the member may be asked to resign from the RAB.

All disclosed conflicts and the actions taken will be documented in the RAB meeting minutes or maintained in a separate log by the Secretary.

## 6. Confidentiality

All disclosures made under this policy will be kept confidential to the extent possible, shared only with those necessary to assess and manage the conflict.

## 7. Compliance and Review

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all RAB members. Failure to comply may result in removal from the Board.

This policy shall be reviewed annually by the RAB and [Specify reviewing body], or as needed. It should be kept consistent with the organization's overall ethics and conflict of interest standards.
