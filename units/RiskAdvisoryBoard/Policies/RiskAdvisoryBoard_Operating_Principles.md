# Risk Advisory Board (RAB) Operating Principles

## 1. Introduction

These Operating Principles outline the fundamental guidelines and expectations for the conduct and operation of the Risk Advisory Board (RAB). They complement the RAB Charter and aim to ensure the Board functions effectively, independently, and ethically.

## 2. Core Principles

Members of the RAB shall adhere to the following core principles:

- **Independence and Objectivity**: Members shall maintain independence in their judgment and provide objective advice, free from undue influence from management or specific interest groups.
- **Expertise and Diligence**: Members are expected to leverage their diverse expertise and exercise due diligence in reviewing materials, participating in discussions, and formulating recommendations.
- **Confidentiality**: Members must uphold strict confidentiality regarding all non-public information discussed or reviewed by the RAB, in accordance with the RAB Confidentiality Policy.
- **Integrity and Ethics**: Members shall act with the highest levels of integrity and ethical conduct, avoiding any conflicts of interest as defined in the RAB Conflict of Interest Policy.
- **Constructive Engagement**: Members should engage in open, honest, and constructive dialogue, fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are valued and debated respectfully.
- **Focus on Strategic Value**: The Board's advice should focus on enhancing the organization's strategic approach to risk management and improving overall resilience.
- **Collaboration**: While maintaining independence, the Board should collaborate effectively with management liaisons and relevant internal stakeholders to gain necessary insights and context.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The Board should periodically reflect on its own effectiveness and seek opportunities to improve its processes and impact (links to Responsibilities 4.f, 4.g).

## 3. Member Expectations

- **Preparation**: Members are expected to thoroughly review meeting materials in advance.
- **Attendance and Participation**: Regular attendance and active participation in meetings are expected.
- **Contribution**: Members should actively contribute their unique expertise and perspectives to discussions.
- **Disclosure**: Members must promptly disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may arise.

## 4. Relationship with Management

The RAB functions as an advisory body. Management retains responsibility for implementing risk management strategies and controls. The relationship should be characterized by mutual respect, transparency, and a shared goal of effective risk management.

## 5. Decision Making

The RAB operates in an advisory capacity. While the Board strives for consensus in its recommendations, formal voting is generally not required. The Chair will articulate the collective or majority advice, noting significant dissenting views if applicable and requested by a member. Recommendations are non-binding on management or the governing body to which the RAB reports.

## 6. Communication Protocols

- **Internal**: Primary communication occurs during scheduled meetings. Between meetings, communication regarding logistics or follow-up actions should be directed through the Secretary. Substantive discussions should generally be reserved for full Board meetings.
- **External**: Members shall not speak publicly on behalf of the RAB or disclose its confidential deliberations unless explicitly authorized according to the Confidentiality Policy and organizational communication protocols.
- **With Management**: Interactions outside of formal presentations should be coordinated through the designated management liaison or the Secretary to ensure efficient communication.

## 7. Review

These Operating Principles shall be reviewed annually in conjunction with the RAB Charter review, or as needed.
