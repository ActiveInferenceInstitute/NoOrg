## 3. Inputs

The primary inputs for the risk review process typically include:
- Risk reports from management (e.g., Enterprise Risk Management reports, specific risk assessments). These should include clear articulation of the risk, methodology used for assessment, key assumptions, potential impact (quantitative where possible), current controls, and proposed mitigation plans.
- Presentations on specific high-priority risks or incidents, including root cause analysis where applicable.

4.  **Formulation of Advice/Recommendations**: Based on the deliberation, the RAB formulates its advisory points or specific recommendations. This involves synthesizing the discussion, striving for consensus where possible, and clearly articulating the advice. The Chair leads this, ensuring dissenting opinions are noted if significant and requested. (See `Advisory_Recommendation_Process.md`).
5.  **Documentation**: Key discussion points, insights, generated questions, and formulated advice/recommendations are captured in the meeting minutes by the Secretary.

- Enhanced understanding of the risk landscape by both the RAB and management.
- Action items for management (based on recommendations) or the RAB Secretary (e.g., follow-up requests for information).

## 8. Follow-up

While the RAB is advisory, it may request updates from management at future meetings on the status of actions taken in response to its recommendations. The Secretary may track key recommendations and agreed-upon management follow-ups for inclusion in future meeting agendas.
