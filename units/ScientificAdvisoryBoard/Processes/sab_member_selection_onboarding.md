# SAB Member Selection & Onboarding Process

## Overview
This process outlines the steps for identifying, vetting, selecting, and onboarding members to the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) to ensure the Board possesses the necessary expertise, independence, and alignment with organizational needs.

## Process Steps

1.  **Identify Expertise Gaps/Needs:**
    *   Based on the [[sab_charter]], current R&D portfolio, strategic direction, and existing member expertise, identify required scientific/technical domains and potential gaps.
    *   Consult with [[Executive]] leadership and [[ResearchDevelopment]] leaders.
2.  **Candidate Identification:**
    *   Source potential candidates through internal networks, existing SAB member recommendations, literature reviews, conference attendance, and potentially specialized search firms.
    *   Prioritize candidates with recognized expertise, relevant experience, diverse perspectives, and availability.
3.  **Initial Vetting & Screening:**
    *   Review candidate CVs, publications, and public profiles.
    *   Conduct preliminary checks for potential conflicts of interest (COI) based on publicly available information.
    *   Internal discussion and shortlisting of potential candidates by SAB Liaison/Management and key internal stakeholders.
4.  **Candidate Outreach & Initial Discussion:**
    *   Make initial contact with shortlisted candidates to gauge interest and availability.
    *   Provide an overview of the SAB mission, expectations, time commitment, and compensation.
    *   Request a formal COI disclosure [[conflict_of_interest_policy_sab]].
5.  **Formal Vetting & COI Review:**
    *   Review submitted COI disclosures with [[Legal]] and [[Compliance]].
    *   Conduct further due diligence as needed.
    *   Assess potential conflicts and determine eligibility or necessary mitigation steps.
6.  **Selection & Invitation:**
    *   Final selection by [[Executive]] leadership based on recommendations.
    *   Issue formal invitation letter outlining terms, responsibilities, compensation, and confidentiality requirements.
7.  **Contracting:**
    *   [[Legal]] prepares and executes the [[sab_member_agreement_template]], including confidentiality agreements.
8.  **Onboarding:**
    *   Provide comprehensive onboarding materials:
        *   [[sab_charter]], [[sab_operating_procedures]]
        *   Organizational overview, relevant strategy documents
        *   Overview of current R&D portfolio
        *   Access details for [[sab_secure_portal]]
        *   Key internal contacts (SAB Liaison)
        *   Schedule of upcoming meetings
    *   Conduct an onboarding session (virtual or in-person) with the SAB Liaison/Chair and potentially key R&D leaders.
9.  **Introduction:**
    *   Formally introduce new members at the next SAB meeting.
