# SAB Meeting Planning & Execution Process

## Overview
This process details the steps involved in planning, preparing for, conducting, and following up on Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) meetings to ensure they are productive, focused, and effectively leverage the expertise of the members.

## Process Steps

1.  **Define Meeting Objectives & Agenda:**
    *   Determine key strategic questions and specific R&D programs/topics requiring SAB input (in consultation with [[Executive]] and [[ResearchDevelopment]] leadership).
    *   Develop a draft agenda outlining session topics, presenters, time allocation, and desired outcomes for each item.
    *   Circulate draft agenda internally for feedback and refinement.
    *   Finalize agenda.
2.  **Prepare Briefing Materials:**
    *   Relevant internal teams ([[ResearchDevelopment]], [[Strategy]], etc.) prepare concise, focused briefing documents, presentations, and data packages for each agenda item.
    *   Materials should clearly state the context, key data, specific questions for the SAB, and desired type of feedback.
    *   Compile all materials into a comprehensive pre-read package.
3.  **Distribute Materials & Confirm Logistics:**
    *   Upload final agenda and pre-read materials to the [[sab_secure_portal]] within the timeframe specified in [[sab_operating_procedures]] (e.g., 1-2 weeks prior).
    *   Notify SAB members of material availability.
    *   Finalize meeting logistics (location/virtual platform link, schedule, AV, catering if applicable).
    *   Confirm attendance of SAB members and key internal participants/presenters.
4.  **Conduct Pre-Meeting Briefing (Internal):**
    *   Hold a brief meeting with internal presenters and key stakeholders to review the agenda, presentation flow, key messages, and specific questions for the SAB.
    *   Ensure alignment and clarity on objectives.
5.  **Execute SAB Meeting:**
    *   **Opening:** Welcome, introductions (if new members), review agenda, confirm objectives, reiterate confidentiality and COI [[conflict_of_interest_policy_sab]].
    *   **Presentations & Discussion:** Internal teams present topics; SAB members ask clarifying questions and engage in discussion.
    *   **Facilitation:** SAB Liaison/Chair facilitates discussion, ensures all members contribute, keeps sessions on time, and guides towards actionable advice.
    *   **Recommendation Capture:** Designated scribe captures key discussion points, divergent views, specific advice, and recommendations (leading to [[sab_recommendation_reporting]]). Ensure clarity on captured points during the meeting.
    *   **Wrap-up:** Summarize key takeaways, outline next steps (including report generation), thank members.
6.  **Post-Meeting Debrief (Internal):**
    *   Hold a brief meeting shortly after the SAB meeting with key internal participants.
    *   Discuss initial impressions, clarify any ambiguities in SAB feedback, and assign internal follow-up actions.
7.  **Draft Meeting Minutes:**
    *   Prepare draft minutes summarizing discussions and key recommendations based on scribe notes.
    *   Circulate draft minutes internally for review and accuracy check.
8.  **Finalize & Distribute Minutes:**
    *   Distribute finalized, non-confidential (or appropriately redacted) minutes to SAB members and relevant internal stakeholders via the [[sab_secure_portal]]. Store in [[MeetingNotes]].
