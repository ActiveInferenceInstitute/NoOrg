# SAB Recommendation Reporting Process

## Overview
This process describes how the advice and recommendations captured during a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) meeting ([[sab_meeting_planning_execution]], [[scientific_review_advisory_process]]) are formally documented, reviewed, and communicated to internal stakeholders for consideration and action.

## Process Steps

1.  **Compile Draft Recommendations:**
    *   Following the SAB meeting, the SAB Liaison/Management and/or Designated Scribe compile the captured key discussion points, advice, and specific recommendations from the meeting notes/scribe record.
    *   Organize recommendations logically, often by agenda topic.
2.  **Internal Review & Clarification:**
    *   Circulate the draft recommendations internally to key participants (presenters, relevant R&D leaders) for review of accuracy and clarity (not for changing the advice itself).
    *   Address any minor clarifications needed based on internal review.
3.  **Draft Formal Report:**
    *   Prepare a formal report summarizing the SAB meeting's key findings and recommendations.
    *   The report typically includes:
        *   Meeting date, attendees (SAB members, key internal personnel).
        *   Executive summary of major themes and advice.
        *   Detailed recommendations section, organized by topic, clearly stating the advice and its rationale (as expressed by SAB).
        *   Acknowledgement of any significant divergent opinions within the SAB.
    *   Reference [[sab_reporting_guidelines]] for format and content requirements.
4.  **Optional: SAB Chair Review:**
    *   Depending on [[sab_operating_procedures]], the draft report may be shared with the SAB Chair for review and comment on the accuracy of representing the Board's discussion and conclusions.
5.  **Finalize Report:**
    *   Incorporate any feedback from the Chair (if applicable).
    *   Final internal approval of the report by SAB Liaison/Management or Executive sponsor.
6.  **Distribute Report:**
    *   Share the final report with the primary internal stakeholders ([[Executive]], [[ResearchDevelopment]] leadership, [[Strategy]], relevant program teams).
    *   Distribute to SAB members for their records via the [[sab_secure_portal]].
    *   Store the official report in the [[Reports]] directory.
7.  **Internal Action Planning (Separate Process):**
    *   Relevant internal teams review the SAB recommendations.
    *   Leadership decides on which recommendations to adopt, modify, or reject, and assigns ownership for resulting actions.
    *   This action planning and tracking is typically managed outside this specific reporting process but is informed by it.
8.  **Feedback Loop (Optional):**
    *   At subsequent SAB meetings, provide a brief update to the SAB on actions taken in response to previous recommendations (demonstrates value and closes the loop).
