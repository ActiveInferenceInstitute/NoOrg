# Ethics Advisory Board (EAB) Processes

## 1. Introduction
This document details the standard operating processes employed by the Ethics Advisory Board (EAB) to execute its responsibilities as defined in the EAB Charter. These processes ensure a systematic, fair, and transparent approach to handling ethical inquiries and developing guidance.

## 2. Core Processes

### 2.1. Ethical Issue Submission and Triage Process ([[ethical_issue_submission_review]])
- **Objective:** To provide a clear channel for raising ethical concerns and to efficiently assess and prioritize them for EAB review.
- **Steps:**
    1.  **Submission:** Concerns/requests are submitted via [[Designated Submission Channel]] using the [[Ethics Submission Form Template]].
    2.  **Receipt & Logging:** The EAB Secretariat logs the submission, assigns a tracking number, and acknowledges receipt within [Number] business days.
    3.  **Initial Triage (Chair/Secretariat):** Review for completeness, clarity, and relevance to EAB scope.
        - If incomplete, request additional information.
        - If outside scope, redirect to the appropriate unit (e.g., HR, Legal, Compliance) and inform the submitter.
        - If within scope, proceed to prioritization.
    4.  **Prioritization:** Assess urgency based on potential impact, timelines, and EAB workload. Urgent matters may trigger an ad-hoc review.
    5.  **Agenda Placement:** Add prioritized, in-scope issues to the agenda for the next suitable EAB meeting.
    6.  **Notification:** Inform the submitter about the status (e.g., accepted for review, redirected, more info needed).

### 2.2. EAB Deliberation and Recommendation Process ([[ethical_guidance_development]])
- **Objective:** To facilitate thorough discussion and development of well-reasoned ethical guidance or recommendations.
- **Steps:**
    1.  **Pre-Reading:** Relevant submission details and background materials are circulated to EAB members [Timeframe] before the meeting.
    2.  **Presentation:** The issue may be briefly presented by the Chair, Secretariat, or the submitter (if invited).
    3.  **COI Check:** Members declare any potential Conflicts of Interest per the [[ethics_advisory_board_policies]].
    4.  **Discussion & Analysis:** Members discuss the ethical dimensions, relevant principles, policies, potential impacts, and stakeholder perspectives.
    5.  **Expert Consultation (Optional):** The EAB may decide to consult subject matter experts if needed.
    6.  **Formulating Recommendations:** The EAB works towards consensus on advice or recommendations. Key points, rationale, and any dissenting views are noted.
    7.  **Decision/Voting (If applicable):** Formal adoption of recommendations may occur via consensus or voting as per the Charter.
    8.  **Documentation:** The Secretariat drafts the recommendation/guidance document based on the deliberation.

### 2.3. Communication and Follow-up Process
- **Objective:** To ensure EAB recommendations are communicated effectively and appropriate follow-up occurs.
- **Steps:**
    1.  **Draft Review:** Draft recommendations/guidance are reviewed by the Chair and potentially the EAB members.
    2.  **Finalization:** Guidance/recommendation document is finalized.
    3.  **Communication:** The finalized document is formally communicated to the original submitter and relevant leadership/units as defined in the Charter or decided by the EAB.
    4.  **Record Keeping:** The submission, deliberation notes (minutes), and final recommendation are archived in the [[EAB Records System]].
    5.  **Follow-up (Optional/Case-dependent):** The EAB may request updates on the implementation or impact of its recommendations at future meetings.

### 2.4. Policy Review Process ([[policy_recommendation_process]])
- **Objective:** To systematically review organizational policies for ethical implications and recommend changes.
- **Steps:**
    1.  **Identification:** Policies for review are identified proactively by the EAB or requested by other units.
    2.  **Analysis:** EAB members review the policy against ethical principles, best practices, and potential impacts.
    3.  **Deliberation:** Discuss findings and potential recommendations during EAB meetings.
    4.  **Recommendation:** Develop specific, actionable recommendations for policy amendments or development.
    5.  **Communication:** Submit recommendations to the policy owner/governing body.

### 2.5. Annual Reporting Process ([[annual_ethics_reporting]])
- **Objective:** To summarize the EAB's activities and provide insights into the organization's ethical climate.
- **Steps:**
    1.  **Data Collection:** Secretariat compiles data on submissions, reviews, recommendations, meeting attendance, etc., throughout the year.
    2.  **Drafting:** Secretariat drafts the annual report based on a [[Annual Report Template]].
    3.  **EAB Review:** The draft report is reviewed and approved by the EAB members.
    4.  **Submission:** The final report is submitted to [[Executive Leadership]] and other stakeholders as per the Charter.
