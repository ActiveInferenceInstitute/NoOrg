# Ethics Advisory Board (EAB) Policies

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the core operational policies governing the Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). These policies ensure consistency, transparency, and effectiveness in the EAB's fulfillment of its chartered responsibilities.

## 2. Core Policies

### 2.1. Confidentiality Policy
- **Objective:** To protect sensitive information shared with or generated by the EAB while maintaining transparency appropriate to its advisory role.
- **Guidelines:**
    - Information designated as confidential by the source or by EAB deliberation shall be handled with strict confidentiality.
    - Member discussions and deliberations are confidential unless otherwise agreed upon for reporting purposes.
    - Public reporting and recommendations will be anonymized and generalized where necessary to protect confidentiality, unless specific disclosure is ethically required and approved.
    - Members are bound by confidentiality agreements.

### 2.2. Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy
- **Objective:** To ensure the independence and impartiality of the EAB's advice by managing potential conflicts of interest.
- **Guidelines:**
    - Members must proactively disclose any potential, perceived, or actual conflicts of interest related to agenda items or topics under review.
    - Disclosure should occur at the beginning of the relevant discussion or as soon as the potential conflict becomes apparent.
    - The Chair, in consultation with other members if necessary, will determine if a conflict exists and whether the member should recuse themselves from discussion and/or voting on the specific matter.
    - All disclosures and recusals will be recorded in the meeting minutes.

### 2.4. Recommendation Development Policy
- **Objective:** To ensure EAB recommendations are well-reasoned, evidence-based, and actionable.
- **Guidelines:**
    - Recommendations will be based on thorough review of the issue, relevant ethical principles, organizational values, policies, and stakeholder perspectives.
    - Deliberations aim for consensus, but dissenting opinions can be recorded if necessary.
    - Recommendations will be clearly articulated, including the rationale and any suggested implementation steps.
    - Recommendations are formally documented and communicated as outlined in the Charter and [[Reporting Process]].

- **Guidelines:**

    - Discussions will be moderated by the Chair to ensure all perspectives are heard.
