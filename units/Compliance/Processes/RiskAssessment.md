# Compliance Risk Assessment

## Purpose
This document outlines the process for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing compliance risks across the organization to guide compliance program activities and resource allocation.

## Scope
This process applies to all compliance risk assessment activities conducted by the Compliance unit in collaboration with business units and other governance functions.

## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Planning and Preparation
- Define assessment objectives and scope
- Establish assessment schedule and timeline
- Identify stakeholders and participants
- Gather relevant documentation and information
- Develop risk assessment methodology and tools

### 2. Risk Identification

#### Regulatory Universe Mapping
- Identify applicable laws, regulations, and standards
- Map regulatory requirements to business activities
- Document regulatory changes and emerging requirements
- Prioritize regulatory domains based on impact

#### Risk Domain Identification
- Product and service risks
- Business process risks
- Geographic and jurisdictional risks
- Third-party and vendor risks
- Technology and system risks
- Organizational culture risks
- Emerging and horizon risks

#### Information Sources
- Regulatory bulletins and guidance
- Industry benchmarks and trends
- Prior compliance issues and incidents
- Audit and assessment findings
- Self-identified risks
- Whistleblower reports
- Business changes and initiatives

### 3. Risk Assessment

#### Risk Evaluation Criteria
- **Inherent Risk Factors**:
  - Probability of non-compliance
  - Potential impact of non-compliance
  - Complexity of requirements
  - Velocity of regulatory change
  - External scrutiny and enforcement focus

- **Control Effectiveness Factors**:
  - Design effectiveness
  - Operating effectiveness
  - Monitoring coverage
  - Testing results
  - Remediation status

#### Risk Rating Methodology
- **Inherent Risk Rating**:
  - Critical (5): Severe impact, high probability
  - High (4): Significant impact, moderate-high probability
  - Medium (3): Moderate impact, moderate probability
  - Low (2): Minor impact, low-moderate probability
  - Minimal (1): Negligible impact, low probability

- **Control Effectiveness Rating**:
  - Strong (4): Comprehensive, effective controls
  - Satisfactory (3): Adequate controls with minor gaps
  - Needs Improvement (2): Significant control weaknesses
  - Weak (1): Inadequate or ineffective controls

- **Residual Risk Calculation**:
  - Residual Risk = Inherent Risk Rating - Control Effectiveness Adjustment
  - Control Effectiveness Adjustment = (Control Effectiveness Rating - 1) / 3 Ã— Inherent Risk Rating

### 4. Risk Prioritization and Response

#### Risk Prioritization
- Critical: Immediate attention and resources required
- High: Significant resources and focus required
- Medium: Managed through routine processes
- Low: Monitored through normal operations
- Minimal: Periodic review only

#### Risk Response Strategies
- Accept: Acknowledge risk with no additional action
- Mitigate: Implement controls to reduce risk
- Transfer: Share risk through insurance or outsourcing
- Avoid: Discontinue activity generating risk

#### Risk Action Planning
- Develop risk mitigation plans
- Assign risk owners and accountabilities
- Establish implementation timelines
- Define success metrics and targets
- Allocate necessary resources

### 5. Documentation and Reporting

#### Risk Assessment Documentation
- Risk assessment methodology
- Risk identification results
- Risk evaluation and ratings
- Control assessment results
- Risk prioritization and response plans

#### Risk Reporting
- Executive summary for leadership
- Detailed report for [[Organization/ComplianceCommittee|Compliance Committee]]
- Risk dashboard for ongoing monitoring
- Business unit-specific risk reports
- Integration with [[../RiskManagement/|Enterprise Risk Management]]

### 6. Monitoring and Review

#### Ongoing Risk Monitoring
- Key risk indicators tracking
- Risk threshold breach reporting
- Emerging risk identification
- Regulatory change impact analysis

#### Periodic Review
- Annual comprehensive risk assessment
- Quarterly risk profile updates
- Ad-hoc assessments for significant changes
- Post-incident risk reassessment
