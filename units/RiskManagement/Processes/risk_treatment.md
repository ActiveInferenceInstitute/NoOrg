# Risk Treatment Process

## 1. Purpose
To select and implement appropriate options for addressing risks identified and assessed as requiring treatment, in order to modify the risk level to align with the organization's risk appetite and tolerance.

## 2. Scope
This process applies to all risks prioritized for treatment following the [[risk_assessment.md]] process.

## 3. Process Steps

### 3.1. Identify Treatment Options
- **Activity:** For each risk requiring treatment, identify potential options. Common categories include:
    - **Avoidance:** Deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the risk (e.g., canceling a project, exiting a market).
    - **Reduction (Mitigation):** Taking action to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk (e.g., implementing new controls, improving processes, adding redundancy).
    - **Transfer (Sharing):** Shifting or sharing a portion of the risk with a third party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing, contractual agreements).
    - **Acceptance (Retention):** Acknowledging the risk and deciding not to take action, often because treatment cost outweighs benefit or residual risk is within appetite. Requires informed decision and approval.
- **Responsibility:** Process/Project/Unit Owner, RMU, SMEs.
- **Inputs:** Assessed risks, understanding of risk context.

### 3.2. Evaluate Treatment Options
- **Activity:** Assess the identified options against predefined criteria, considering:
    - **Effectiveness:** How well the option modifies the risk (likelihood/impact).
    - **Cost vs. Benefit:** The resources required versus the expected reduction in risk exposure.
    - **Feasibility:** Technical, operational, and financial viability of implementation.
    - **Alignment:** Consistency with organizational objectives, policies, and values.
    - **Residual Risk:** The level of risk remaining after the treatment is applied.
    - **Stakeholder Impact:** Effects on internal and external stakeholders.
- **Responsibility:** Process/Project/Unit Owner, RMU, Finance, Legal, SMEs.
- **Inputs:** Treatment options, risk assessment data, cost-benefit analysis, feasibility studies.

### 3.3. Select Best Option(s)
- **Activity:** Choose the most appropriate treatment option or combination of options based on the evaluation. The goal is typically to reduce the risk to an acceptable level (within tolerance) in a cost-effective manner.
- **Responsibility:** Process/Project/Unit Owner (with approval from Management/Risk Committee for significant risks/expenditures).
- **Inputs:** Evaluation results, risk appetite/tolerance, budget constraints.

### 3.4. Develop Treatment Plan
- **Activity:** Create a detailed action plan for implementing the selected treatment(s). The plan should specify:
    - Specific actions required.
    - Resources needed (budget, personnel, time).
    - Assigned responsibilities and ownership.
    - Implementation timeline and milestones.
    - Performance measures and reporting requirements to track progress and effectiveness.
    - Expected residual risk level.
- **Responsibility:** Process/Project/Unit Owner, assigned action owners.
- **Inputs:** Selected treatment option(s), resource availability.

### 3.5. Implement Treatment Plan
- **Activity:** Execute the actions outlined in the treatment plan according to the defined timeline and responsibilities.
- **Responsibility:** Assigned action owners, Process/Project/Unit Owner (oversight).

### 3.6. Update Risk Register
- **Activity:** Document the selected treatment option(s), the detailed treatment plan (or reference to it), implementation status, responsible parties, timelines, and the target residual risk level in the [[Risk Register]].
- **Responsibility:** RMU, Process/Project/Unit Owner.

## 4. Inputs
- [[Risk Register]] (with assessed and prioritized risks)
- [[risk_assessment.md]] outputs
- [[Risk Appetite Statement]] & Risk Criteria
- Resource availability information (budget, personnel)
- Cost-benefit analysis data
- Stakeholder consultation results

## 5. Outputs
- Approved Risk Treatment Plans.
- Updated [[Risk Register]] with treatment details, status, and residual risk estimates.
- Actions assigned for implementation.
- Input for [[risk_monitoring.md]] process.

## 6. Tools and Techniques
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Control Design & Implementation Techniques
- Project Management Methodologies (for plan execution)
- Contract Negotiation (for risk transfer)
- Process Re-engineering (for risk reduction)
- Risk Register Software/Template

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Risk Management Unit (RMU):** Facilitates the process, advises on options, reviews plans for consistency, tracks overall implementation progress.
- **Process/Project/Unit Owners:** Lead development and oversee implementation of treatment plans within their scope, secure necessary approvals.
- **Action Owners:** Implement specific treatment actions as assigned.
- **Management / Risk Committee:** Approve significant treatment plans and expenditures, review residual risk levels against appetite.
- **Finance/Legal/IT/HR etc.:** Provide expertise and support for specific treatment options (e.g., financial analysis, contract review, technical solutions).

## 8. Review and Update
- The effectiveness of implemented treatment plans should be regularly reviewed as part of the [[risk_monitoring.md]] process.
- This process document will be reviewed annually by the RMU.
