# Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Policy

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Purpose
This policy establishes the framework, principles, and responsibilities for managing risks across the organization. It aims to integrate risk management into the organizational culture, strategic planning, and operational processes to support the achievement of objectives and enhance resilience.

### 1.2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, units, functions, activities, and operations of the organization.

### 1.3. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to a proactive, comprehensive, and integrated approach to risk management. We recognize that risk is inherent in all activities and strive to manage it effectively to protect our assets, reputation, and stakeholders, while pursuing strategic opportunities.

## 2. Definitions
- **Risk:** The effect of uncertainty on objectives (Source: ISO 31000). Risk is often expressed in terms of risk sources, potential events, their consequences, and their likelihood.
- **Risk Management:** Coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk (Source: ISO 31000).
- **Risk Appetite:** The amount and type of risk that an organization is willing to pursue or retain.
- **Risk Tolerance:** The organization's or stakeholder's readiness to bear the risk after risk treatment in order to achieve its objectives.
- **Risk Assessment:** The overall process of risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation.
- **Risk Treatment:** Process to modify risk (e.g., avoid, reduce, transfer, accept).
- **Risk Register:** A documented record of identified risks, including details such as nature, likelihood, impact, owner, and treatment status.
- **ERM Framework:** The set of components that provide the foundations and organizational arrangements for designing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing, and continually improving risk management throughout the organization (Source: ISO 31000).

## 3. Principles
Our risk management approach is based on the following principles (aligned with ISO 31000):
- **Integrated:** Risk management is an integral part of all organizational activities.
- **Structured and Comprehensive:** A systematic and timely approach contributes to efficiency and consistent, comparable, and reliable results.
- **Customized:** The framework and process are tailored to the organization's external and internal context and risk profile.
- **Inclusive:** Appropriate and timely involvement of stakeholders enables their knowledge, views, and perceptions to be considered.
- **Dynamic:** Risk management anticipates, detects, acknowledges, and responds to changes and events in an appropriate and timely manner.
- **Best Available Information:** Inputs are based on historical and current information, as well as on future expectations, considering limitations and uncertainties.
- **Human and Cultural Factors:** Human behavior and culture significantly influence all aspects of risk management.
- **Continual Improvement:** Risk management is continually improved through learning and experience.
