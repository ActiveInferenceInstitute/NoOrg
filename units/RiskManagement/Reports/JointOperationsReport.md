## Process Control Improvements

Based on joint [[../../Operations/Processes/QualityControl|Quality Control]] and risk assessments, the following process control improvements have been implemented:

1. **Order Fulfillment Process**
   - Automated verification checkpoint added
   - Exception handling procedure updated
   - [[../../Operations/Processes/ProcessManagement|Process documentation]] updated

2. **Customer Data Management**
   - Access control restrictions enhanced
   - Data validation controls strengthened
   - Audit trail monitoring expanded

3. **Financial Reconciliation**
   - Approval threshold review completed
   - Daily reconciliation checks implemented
   - [[../../Operations/Processes/ResourceOptimization|Resource optimization]] achieved through automation

## Emerging Concerns

### Technology Infrastructure
Increasing reliance on cloud services has introduced new dependencies. Joint assessment with IT reveals potential availability risks. Recommend developing enhanced resilience requirements and supplier management controls.

### Regulatory Changes
Upcoming regulatory changes in data protection will impact operational processes. Cross-functional working group established with [[../../Compliance/README|Compliance Unit]] to assess impact and develop implementation plan.

## Recommendations

1. **Executive Approval Needed**: Expedite approval for alternate supplier onboarding to address supply chain risk (HR-OPS-2023-05)
2. **Resource Allocation**: Increase resource allocation to customer support cross-training program
3. **Policy Update**: Review and update operational resilience policies to align with new business continuity standards
4. **Technology Investment**: Prioritize legacy system replacement to mitigate operational technology risks
