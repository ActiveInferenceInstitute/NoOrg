# Strategic Initiative Management Process

## Purpose

This process governs how strategic initiatives are identified, prioritized, resourced, executed, and measured to ensure effective strategy execution.

## Initiative Lifecycle

```
Ideation → Evaluation → Approval → Execution → Measurement → Closure
```

## Phase 1: Ideation

### Initiative Sources

- Strategic planning cycle outputs
- Market opportunity identification
- Executive or Board direction
- Cross-functional innovation proposals

### Initiative Proposal

All proposals must include:

- Strategic alignment justification
- Business case (benefits, costs, risks)
- Resource requirements
- Timeline and milestones
- Success metrics

## Phase 2: Evaluation

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Strategic alignment | 30% | Fit with priorities |
| Business value | 25% | NPV/ROI analysis |
| Feasibility | 20% | Capability to execute |
| Risk | 15% | Risk assessment |
| Dependencies | 10% | Integration complexity |

### Portfolio Fit

- Capacity vs. demand analysis
- Interdependency mapping
- Risk diversification check

## Phase 3: Approval

| Initiative Size | Approval Authority |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Small (<$100K, <3 months) | Strategy Director |
| Medium ($100K-$1M) | Executive Sponsor |
| Large (>$1M) | Executive Committee |
| Transformational | Board of Directors |

## Phase 4: Execution

### Governance

- Assigned executive sponsor
- Dedicated initiative lead
- Regular status reporting
