# Scenario Planning Process

## Purpose

This process establishes how the organization conducts scenario planning to stress-test strategies and prepare for alternative futures.

## Overview

Scenario planning develops multiple plausible future states to:

- Challenge strategic assumptions
- Identify early warning signals
- Build organizational adaptability
- Inform robust decision-making

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Focal Question Definition

- Define the strategic question to address
- Set time horizon (typically 5-10 years)
- Identify key stakeholders
- Align with strategic planning cycle

### Step 2: Environmental Scanning

Gather inputs across dimensions:

| Dimension | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Political | Regulatory changes, trade policy |
| Economic | Growth rates, inflation, disruption |
| Social | Demographics, consumer behavior |
| Technological | Innovation, digitization |
| Environmental | Climate, sustainability |
| Legal | Compliance, liability |

### Step 3: Driving Forces

- Identify key driving forces affecting the focal question
- Assess impact and uncertainty of each force
- Select 2-3 critical uncertainties as scenario axes

### Step 4: Scenario Development

- Create 3-4 distinct, plausible scenarios
- Name each scenario memorably
- Develop rich narratives for each
- Validate internal consistency

### Scenario Framework Example

```
                 High Economic Growth
                        |
  Scenario A:          |         Scenario B:
  "Tech Boom"          |         "Steady State"
                       |
   Rapid Change -------|------- Gradual Change
                       |
  Scenario C:          |         Scenario D:
  "Disruption"         |         "New Normal"
                       |
                 Low Economic Growth
```

### Step 5: Strategy Implications

For each scenario:

- Assess current strategy resilience
- Identify required pivot actions
- Define early warning indicators
- Document strategic options

### Step 6: Integration

- Present to leadership
- Incorporate into strategic planning
- Establish monitoring mechanisms
- Schedule scenario refresh cycle

## Outputs

- Scenario narratives document
- Strategy implications matrix
- Early warning indicators dashboard
- Contingent action plans
