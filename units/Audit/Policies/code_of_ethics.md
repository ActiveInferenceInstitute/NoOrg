## 1. Purpose
This policy adopts and requires adherence to a professional code of ethics to guide the conduct of Audit Unit personnel. It is essential for maintaining trust, credibility, and professionalism.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all personnel within the Audit Unit.

## 3. Policy Statement
The Audit Unit adopts The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Code of Ethics. All Audit Unit personnel are required to understand and comply with its principles and rules of conduct.

The IIA Code of Ethics consists of two essential components:
1.  **Principles:** Relevant to the profession and practice of internal auditing.
2.  **Rules of Conduct:** Describe behavior norms expected of internal auditors. These rules are an aid to interpreting the Principles into practical applications and are intended to guide the ethical conduct of internal auditors.

### 3.1. Principles
Internal auditors are expected to apply and uphold the following principles:

-   **Integrity:** The integrity of internal auditors establishes trust and thus provides the basis for reliance on their judgment.
-   **Objectivity:** Internal auditors exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors make a balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and are not unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.
-   **Confidentiality:** Internal auditors respect the value and ownership of information they receive and do not disclose information without appropriate authority unless there is a legal or professional obligation to do so.
-   **Competency:** Internal auditors apply the knowledge, skills, and experience needed in the performance of internal audit services.
