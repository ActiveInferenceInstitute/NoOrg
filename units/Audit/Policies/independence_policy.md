# Audit Unit Independence and Objectivity Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines to ensure the independence and objectivity of the Audit Unit and its personnel, which are fundamental to the effectiveness and credibility of the internal audit function.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to the Audit Unit as a whole and to all individual auditors (including staff, managers, directors, and any co-sourced or outsourced resources performing audit work).

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1. Organizational Independence
- The Audit Unit shall be positioned within the organization to ensure its independence.
- The [[Audit Director]] shall report functionally to the highest level of governance within the organization (e.g., the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors) and administratively to the [[Executive]].
- Functional reporting includes approving the audit charter, risk-based internal audit plan, audit budget and resource plan, receiving communications from the [[Audit Director]] on the internal audit activity's performance relative to its plan and other matters, and approving decisions regarding the appointment and removal of the [[Audit Director]].
- The Audit Unit shall have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited.
- The scope of internal auditing shall not be restricted in any way.

### 3.2. Individual Objectivity
- Auditors must maintain an impartial, unbiased attitude and avoid any conflicts of interest.
- Auditors must not subordinate their judgment on audit matters to others.
- Auditors shall not assess specific operations for which they were previously responsible within the past year (or longer period as deemed appropriate).
- Audits of functions where the [[Audit Director]] has prior significant responsibility should be overseen by a party outside the internal audit activity.
- Auditors shall not accept fees, gifts, or entertainment from an employee, client, customer, supplier, or business associate that may create the appearance that objectivity has been impaired.

### 3.3. Impairment to Independence or Objectivity
- If independence or objectivity is impaired in fact or appearance, the details of the impairment must be disclosed to appropriate parties (e.g., [[Audit Director]], Audit Committee).
- The nature of the disclosure will depend upon the impairment and may require reassignment of audit staff or engagement of external resources.
- Potential impairments include, but are not limited to:
    - Personal conflict of interest.
    - Scope limitations.
    - Restrictions on access to records, personnel, and properties.
    - Resource limitations, such as funding.

### 3.4. Disclosure of Conflicts
- Auditors are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest or impairments to objectivity to the [[Audit Director]] upon discovery.
- An annual declaration of independence and objectivity shall be completed by all Audit Unit personnel.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Audit Personnel:** Adhere to this policy, maintain objectivity, disclose potential impairments.
- **Audit Director:** Implement this policy, monitor compliance, manage disclosures, report impairments to the Audit Committee and [[Executive]].
- **Audit Committee/Board:** Uphold the independence of the Audit Unit, review disclosures of impairment.
