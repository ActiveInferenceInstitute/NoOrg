- **Objectivity:** Reports must be fair, impartial, and unbiased.
- **Clarity:** Reports must be easy to understand and use clear, concise language, avoiding unnecessary technical jargon.
- **Conciseness:** Reports should be direct and avoid unnecessary detail while still conveying necessary information.
- **Constructiveness:** Reports should help the auditee and the organization, promoting improvement.
- **Completeness:** Reports must contain all significant information needed to understand the findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
- **Timeliness:** Reports should be issued promptly after the completion of fieldwork to maximize their usefulness.
