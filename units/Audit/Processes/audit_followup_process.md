# Audit Follow-up Process

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the process for monitoring and verifying the implementation and effectiveness of management action plans developed in response to audit findings and recommendations.

## 2. Scope
This process applies to all audit findings where management has agreed to implement corrective actions.

## 3. Process Steps
1.  **Tracking Initiation:** Following the issuance of the final audit report ([[audit_reporting.md]]), log the agreed-upon management action plans, responsible individuals, and target implementation dates into a tracking system (e.g., [[audit_management_system]]).
2.  **Status Monitoring:** Periodically (e.g., quarterly or based on implementation dates) request status updates from management regarding the implementation of action plans.
3.  **Verification Planning:** Based on the nature of the finding and the action plan, determine the appropriate method and timing for verifying implementation and effectiveness. High-risk findings typically require more rigorous verification.
4.  **Verification Execution:** Perform procedures to verify that the action plan has been implemented and is effectively addressing the original finding.
    *   Methods: Reviewing updated documentation, testing new controls, interviewing personnel, observing processes, data analysis.
5.  **Documentation:** Document the follow-up procedures performed, evidence obtained, and conclusion regarding the status of the action plan (e.g., Implemented and Effective, Implemented but Not Yet Effective, Not Implemented, Superseded).
6.  **Reporting:** Periodically report the status of outstanding audit findings and follow-up activities to senior management and the Audit Committee.
7.  **Closure:** Formally close findings in the tracking system once verification confirms effective implementation.
8.  **Escalation:** Escalate overdue or ineffective action plans to senior management and the Audit Committee as appropriate.
