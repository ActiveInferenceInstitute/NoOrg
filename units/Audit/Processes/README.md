# Audit Unit - Processes

This directory documents the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and key processes followed by the Audit Unit.

## Structure
- Each major process identified in the [[auditunit.md]] document should have its own file (e.g., `audit_planning.md`, `audit_execution.md`).
- Files should detail the steps, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and controls for each process.
