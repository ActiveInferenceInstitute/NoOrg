# Control Evaluation Process

## 1. Purpose
This document describes the process for evaluating the design adequacy and operating effectiveness of internal controls within the organization's processes, systems, and operations.

## 2. Scope
This process is integral to various types of audits (financial, operational, IT, compliance) conducted by the Audit Unit where assessment of internal controls is an objective.

## 3. Process Steps
1.  **Understand the Process/System:** Gain a thorough understanding of the process or system under review, including objectives, risks, and existing control activities.
2.  **Identify Key Controls:** Identify the controls that are most critical for mitigating significant risks.
3.  **Assess Control Design:** Evaluate whether the identified key controls are designed effectively to prevent or detect potential misstatements or failures, assuming the controls operate as prescribed.
    *   Methods: Walkthroughs, interviews, documentation review.
4.  **Test Operating Effectiveness:** If the design is deemed effective, test whether the controls are operating consistently and as intended over a period of time.
    *   Methods: Inquiry, observation, inspection of documents, re-performance, data analysis.
    *   Determine appropriate sample sizes and testing periods.
5.  **Document Testing and Results:** Clearly document the control evaluation procedures performed, the evidence obtained, and the conclusion regarding control effectiveness (e.g., effective, ineffective, needs improvement).
6.  **Identify Control Deficiencies:** Based on the evaluation, identify any control deficiencies (design or operating effectiveness weaknesses).
7.  **Report Deficiencies:** Include identified control deficiencies in audit findings, following the [[audit_reporting.md|Audit Reporting Process]].

## 4. Inputs
- Process documentation (flowcharts, narratives)
- Risk assessments
- Control descriptions/matrices (e.g., Risk Control Matrix)
- Prior audit results related to controls
- Audit Engagement Plan

## 5. Outputs
- Documented understanding of the process and controls
- Assessment of control design adequacy
- Results of control operating effectiveness testing
- Documented control deficiencies
- Input into overall audit findings and conclusions

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Audit Staff/Leads:** Perform control walkthroughs, design and execute tests of controls, document results.
- **Audit Managers:** Review control evaluation approach and documentation, validate conclusions.
- **Auditee Management/Staff:** Provide information about processes and controls, provide evidence for testing.

## 7. Controls
- Use of standardized control testing templates and methodologies.
- Defined criteria for assessing significance of deficiencies.
- Supervisory review of control evaluation workpapers.
- Linkage of controls tested to specific risks and audit objectives.
