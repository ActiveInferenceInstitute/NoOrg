# Human Resources Compensation Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the organization's philosophy, principles, and practices regarding employee compensation. The goal is to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees by providing fair, equitable, competitive, and performance-based compensation aligned with the organization's strategic objectives, financial performance, and values.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all regular employees of the organization. Executive compensation may be subject to additional oversight by the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee.

## 3. Compensation Philosophy

Our compensation philosophy is based on:
*   **Market Competitiveness:** Providing compensation opportunities (base salary, incentives, benefits) that are competitive within the relevant labor markets and industries where we operate and compete for talent.
*   **Internal Equity:** Ensuring pay is fair and equitable for employees performing similar work, considering factors like skills, experience, performance, and responsibility, while avoiding discriminatory practices.
*   **Performance-Based Pay:** Linking a portion of compensation to individual, team, and/or organizational performance, where appropriate.
*   **Transparency:** Communicating the compensation philosophy and program structure clearly to employees (while maintaining individual pay confidentiality).
*   **Compliance:** Adhering to all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding minimum wage, overtime, equal pay, and other compensation-related matters.
*   **Fiscal Responsibility:** Managing compensation programs in a financially sustainable manner aligned with the organization's budget and performance.

## 4. Compensation Components

Our total compensation program may include the following components:
*   **Base Salary:** Fixed compensation paid on a regular schedule, determined by job role, level, market data, experience, skills, and internal equity.
*   **Variable Pay/Incentives (if applicable):** Performance-based pay, such as bonuses, commissions, or other incentive plans tied to specific, measurable goals.
*   **Benefits:** Health and welfare plans, retirement savings plans, paid time off, and other non-cash rewards (refer to [Benefits Overview](AGENTS.md)).
*   **Equity/Long-Term Incentives (if applicable):** Stock options, restricted stock units, or other long-term programs, typically for specific employee groups.

## 5. Compensation Administration

*   **Job Evaluation & Leveling:** Positions are evaluated and grouped into job levels or grades based on factors like scope, responsibility, complexity, and required skills.
*   **Salary Structures:** Formal salary ranges (minimum, midpoint, maximum) are established for job levels based on market data and internal analysis. These ranges are reviewed periodically.
*   **Market Analysis:** HR regularly reviews external market data (using reputable salary surveys) to ensure our compensation structures remain competitive.
*   **Salary Reviews:** Employee base salaries are typically reviewed annually as part of the [Compensation Review Process](../Processes/AGENTS.md), considering factors like performance, position in range, market adjustments, and budget availability.
*   **Promotional Increases:** Salary increases associated with promotions reflect the increased responsibilities and market value of the new role.
*   **New Hire Offers:** Starting salaries are determined based on the candidate's qualifications, experience, internal equity, the position's salary range, and market conditions.

## 6. Compliance

*   All compensation decisions will comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regarding minimum wage, overtime pay for non-exempt employees, and proper classification of exempt/non-exempt status.
*   Compensation practices will adhere to the Equal Pay Act and other non-discrimination laws, ensuring pay equity regardless of gender, race, religion, age, or other protected characteristics.

## 7. Confidentiality

Individual employee compensation details are considered confidential information. Discussing personal compensation with colleagues is generally discouraged [or state specific company stance]. Managers and HR personnel must maintain strict confidentiality regarding employee pay data.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Human Resources:** Develops, administers, and communicates the compensation program; conducts market analysis; ensures compliance; advises managers.
*   **Managers:** Make salary recommendations for their team members based on policy, performance, and budget; communicate compensation decisions; ensure equity within their teams.
*   **Executive Leadership/Compensation Committee:** Approves overall compensation philosophy, structures, budgets, and specific executive pay actions.

## 9. Review

This policy and associated compensation structures will be reviewed periodically (typically annually) by HR and Executive Leadership/Compensation Committee to ensure they remain competitive, equitable, compliant, and aligned with organizational goals.
