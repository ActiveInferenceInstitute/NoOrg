*   **Manager:** Receives/communicates notice, notifies HR, coordinates knowledge transfer, approves final timesheet, collects immediate company assets (e.g., laptop on last day), manages team communication.
*   **Human Resources (HR):** Owns the overall process, manages documentation (separation agreement, final pay, benefits info), conducts exit interviews, coordinates with other departments, ensures compliance, updates systems.
*   **IT Department:** Disables system access, email accounts, retrieves IT assets.
