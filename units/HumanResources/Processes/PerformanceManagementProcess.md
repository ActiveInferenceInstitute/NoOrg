# Human Resources Performance Management Process

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the organization's standard process for managing employee performance. The goals are to align individual performance with organizational objectives, provide regular and constructive feedback, support employee development, ensure accountability, and inform decisions regarding compensation, promotion, and retention.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all regular employees [Specify exceptions, e.g., excluding those in introductory period, executives under a different process]. It typically follows an annual cycle, complemented by ongoing feedback and check-ins throughout the year.

## 3. Principles

*   **Alignment:** Goals are cascaded from organizational objectives.
*   **Clarity:** Expectations and performance standards are clearly defined.
*   **Fairness & Consistency:** Process applied equitably across the organization.
*   **Ongoing Feedback:** Regular communication between manager and employee is crucial, not just during formal reviews.
*   **Development Focus:** Emphasizes growth, learning, and career development.
*   **Accountability:** Both managers and employees are accountable for their roles in the process.
*   **Objectivity:** Evaluations based on measurable results and observable behaviors where possible.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Employee:** Actively participates in goal setting, seeks feedback, prepares self-assessment, engages in review discussions, focuses on development.
*   **Manager:** Sets clear expectations, provides ongoing coaching and feedback, conducts formal reviews, supports employee development, ensures fair assessment, documents performance.
*   **Second-Level Manager (Manager's Manager):** Reviews and approves performance ratings and recommendations (calibration), ensures consistency within their function.
*   **Human Resources (HR):** Owns and facilitates the overall process, provides tools and training, ensures compliance and consistency, manages system administration, advises managers and employees, facilitates calibration sessions.
*   **Executive Leadership:** Sets overall tone and strategic priorities that inform performance expectations.

## 5. Performance Management Cycle (Annual Example)

1.  **Goal Setting (Start of Cycle - e.g., Q1):**
    *   Managers and employees collaboratively set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) aligned with team and organizational objectives.
    *   Development goals are also identified.
    *   Goals documented in [Performance Management System/Tool or Form].
2.  **Ongoing Feedback & Check-ins (Throughout Year):**
    *   Managers provide regular informal feedback (positive and constructive).
    *   Regular 1:1 meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and provide support.
    *   Mid-year check-in (formal or informal) to review progress against goals and make adjustments if needed.
3.  **Year-End Self-Assessment (End of Cycle - e.g., Q4):**
    *   Employee completes a self-assessment reflecting on achievements against goals, contributions, strengths, and development areas.
4.  **Manager Assessment (End of Cycle - e.g., Q4/Q1):**
    *   Manager reviews employee self-assessment, performance data, feedback received (if using 360), and own observations.
    *   Manager drafts the performance review, including ratings against goals and overall performance.
5.  **Calibration Sessions (Optional but Recommended - e.g., Q1):**
    *   Managers meet (facilitated by HR and overseen by second-level managers/leadership) to discuss ratings across teams/functions to ensure consistency and fairness.
    *   Ratings may be adjusted based on calibration discussions.
6.  **Performance Review Meeting (e.g., Q1):**
    *   Formal meeting between manager and employee to discuss the review document.
    *   Focus on achievements, areas for development, overall performance rating, and career aspirations.
    *   Finalize review documentation and obtain signatures (if required).
7.  **Link to Outcomes (Following Review - e.g., Q1/Q2):**
    *   Performance outcomes inform compensation decisions (merit increases, bonuses) per the [Compensation Review Process](AGENTS.md).
    *   Performance data informs promotion readiness and succession planning.
    *   Development needs feed into training plans.
8.  **Cycle Restart:** Begin goal setting for the next performance cycle.

## 7. Performance Ratings

*   Define the rating scale used (e.g., 3-point, 5-point scale: Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Needs Improvement).
*   Provide clear descriptions for each rating level.

## 8. Handling Poor Performance

*   Address performance issues promptly and directly through coaching and feedback.
*   If issues persist, implement a formal Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in consultation with HR, outlining specific expectations, support, and timelines.
*   Refer to the [Disciplinary Action Policy](../Policies/AGENTS.md) if necessary.

## 10. Review Cycle

This process, including forms and system configuration, will be reviewed annually by HR leadership, with input from managers and employees, to ensure effectiveness, fairness, and alignment with organizational needs.
