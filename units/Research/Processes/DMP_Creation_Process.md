# Data Management Plan (DMP) Creation Process

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Research Unit Lead

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the process for creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) for research projects within the Research Unit. A DMP describes how research data will be managed throughout the project lifecycle and after its completion.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all research projects initiated within the Research Unit that generate or collect data, as required by [[../Policies/Data_Handling_Policy.md]].

## 4. Steps Description

1.  **Identify Data Types & Sources:** Determine what kinds of data will be generated or collected (e.g., survey results, experimental measurements, code, simulations, interview transcripts). Note formats, expected volume.
2.  **Determine Metadata Standards:** Define how data will be documented (metadata) to ensure it is understandable and reusable (e.g., variable definitions, codebooks, experimental conditions).
3.  **Plan Data Storage & Backup:** Select appropriate, secure storage solutions (referencing approved organizational platforms). Define the backup frequency and procedures.
4.  **Define Data Security Measures:** Based on data sensitivity (see [[../Policies/Data_Handling_Policy.md]]), specify security controls (access controls, encryption, anonymization needs).
5.  **Outline Data Access & Sharing Policies:** Define who will have access to the data during and after the project. Outline conditions and procedures for sharing data (internally/externally), considering ethical and IP constraints.
6.  **Establish Data Preservation & Retention Plan:** Determine which data needs to be preserved long-term, for how long (retention period), and where it will be archived. Plan for data disposal.
7.  **Assign Roles & Responsibilities:** Clearly define who is responsible for implementing and overseeing the DMP activities.
8.  **Draft DMP Document:** Compile the information into a formal DMP document using an approved template or online tool (e.g., DMPTool, institutional template).
9.  **Review DMP:** Have the draft DMP reviewed by relevant stakeholders (e.g., PI, Research Lead, IT, Ethics Committee if applicable).
10. **Finalize & Store DMP:** Incorporate feedback, finalize the DMP, and store it in a designated project location.
11. **Implement DMP:** Follow the plan during the project execution phase (see [[Research_Project_Lifecycle.md]]).
12. **Update DMP:** Review and update the DMP if significant changes occur during the project (e.g., new data types, changes in storage, new sharing agreements).
13. **Execute Retention/Disposal:** Follow the DMP's plan for data archiving, sharing, or disposal at the end of the project lifecycle and retention period.
