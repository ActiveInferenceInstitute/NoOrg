# Research Methodologies & Standards

This document describes the methodologies, standards, and best practices employed by the Research Unit. Adherence to these ensures rigor, reproducibility, and ethical conduct in our research activities.

## Research Approaches

Depending on the focus area and project goals, we utilize a range of qualitative and quantitative methods:

- **Literature Review**: Systematic review of existing academic papers, industry reports, and patents
- **Qualitative Research**: Interviews, focus groups, ethnographic studies, case studies
- **Quantitative Research**: Surveys, experiments, statistical modeling, data mining
- **Prototyping & Experimentation**: Building and testing proof-of-concepts, simulations (often involves [Development](../Development/))
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing performance or features against existing solutions or standards

## Standards and Best Practices

### Research Ethics
