# Research Methodologies & Standards

This document describes the methodologies, standards, and best practices employed by the [[index|Research Unit]]. Adherence to these ensures rigor, reproducibility, and ethical conduct in our research activities.

## Research Approaches

Depending on the [[FocusAreas|focus area]] and project goals, we utilize a range of qualitative and quantitative methods:

*   **Literature Review**: Systematic review of existing academic papers, industry reports, and patents.
*   **Qualitative Research**: Interviews, focus groups, ethnographic studies, case studies.
*   **Quantitative Research**: Surveys, experiments, statistical modeling, data mining.
*   **Prototyping & Experimentation**: Building and testing proof-of-concepts, simulations. (Often involves [[../Development/|Development]]).
*   **Benchmarking**: Comparing performance or features against existing solutions or standards.

## Standards and Best Practices

*   **Research Ethics**: Adherence to [[../EthicsAdvisoryBoard/Policies/ResearchEthicsPolicy|Research Ethics Policy]] (Link TBD), including informed consent, data privacy ([Link to [[../Legal/Policies/DataPrivacy|Data Privacy Policy]] TBD]), and responsible innovation principles.
*   **Data Management**: Secure storage, version control, and documentation of datasets. See [[Processes/DataManagementProcess|Data Management Process]].
*   **Reproducibility**: Clear documentation of methods, code (using [[../Development/Standards/CodeRepositoryPolicy|code repositories]] - Link TBD), and analysis steps.
*   **Peer Review**: Internal review process for key findings and publications. See [[Processes/PeerReviewProcess|Peer Review Process]].
*   **Publication & Dissemination**: Guidelines for sharing research findings internally and externally. See [[Policies/PublicationPolicy|Publication Policy]].
