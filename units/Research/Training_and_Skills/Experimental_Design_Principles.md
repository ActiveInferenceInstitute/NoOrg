# Guide: Experimental Design Principles

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Audience:** Research Unit Personnel involved in experimental research

## 1. Purpose

To outline fundamental principles of experimental design, ensuring that research conducted within the unit is rigorous, valid, and produces reliable results.

## 2. Key Principles

1.  **Clear Objectives & Hypotheses:**
    *   Start with well-defined research questions and specific, testable hypotheses.
    *   What effect are you trying to measure? What comparisons are you making?
2.  **Control Group:**
    *   Include a control group (receiving no treatment or a standard treatment/placebo) whenever possible to provide a baseline for comparison.
    *   This helps isolate the effect of the variable(s) being tested.
3.  **Randomization:**
    *   Randomly assign subjects (participants, samples, experimental units) to treatment and control groups.
    *   This minimizes systematic bias and helps ensure groups are comparable at the start.
    *   Randomize the order of treatments or trials if applicable to control for time effects.
4.  **Replication:**
    *   Include multiple independent experimental units within each group (biological replicates).
    *   Repeat measurements on the same unit if appropriate (technical replicates), but distinguish this from biological replication.
    *   Replication increases the reliability of results and allows for estimation of variability.
5.  **Blocking (Optional but often useful):**
    *   If there are known sources of variability that cannot be controlled (e.g., different batches of materials, different operators, time of day), group experimental units into blocks.
    *   Apply all treatments within each block.
    *   This helps control for the known source of variability, making it easier to detect treatment effects.
6.  **Factorial Design (for multiple variables):**
    *   To study the effects of two or more independent variables (factors) simultaneously, use a factorial design.
    *   This involves testing all possible combinations of the factor levels.
    *   Allows assessment of main effects of each factor and interaction effects between factors.
7.  **Blinding (where applicable):**
    *   If possible, blind researchers and/or subjects to group assignments (single-blind or double-blind).
    *   This prevents bias in data collection, measurement, or interpretation due to knowledge of treatment allocation.
8.  **Appropriate Sample Size:**
    *   Determine the required sample size *before* starting the experiment using power analysis.
    *   Ensures the study has sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful effects if they exist.
9.  **Standardization:**
    *   Keep all conditions constant except for the variables being tested.
    *   Use standardized protocols and calibrated equipment.

## 3. Planning Considerations

*   **Variables:** Clearly identify independent, dependent, and potential confounding variables.
*   **Measurement:** Use valid and reliable methods for measuring outcomes.
*   **Feasibility:** Consider available resources (time, budget, personnel, equipment).
*   **Ethics:** Ensure the design complies with [[../Policies/Research_Ethics_Policy.md]].
