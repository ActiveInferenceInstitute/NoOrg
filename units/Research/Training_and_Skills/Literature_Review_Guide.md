# Guide: Conducting Effective Literature Reviews

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Audience:** Research Unit Personnel

## 1. Purpose

To provide a brief guide on conducting systematic and comprehensive literature reviews to inform research questions, understand the current state of knowledge, identify gaps, and contextualize findings.

## 2. Key Steps

1.  **Define the Scope & Question:**
    *   Clearly articulate the research question(s) the review aims to answer.
    *   Define inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., time period, study types, languages).
2.  **Develop Search Strategy:**
    *   Identify relevant databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, domain-specific databases).
    *   Develop robust search strings using keywords, synonyms, Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), and database-specific syntax.
    *   Consider searching grey literature (e.g., conference proceedings, dissertations, reports).
3.  **Execute Search & Screen Results:**
    *   Run searches across selected databases.
    *   Use reference management software (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) to collect and de-duplicate results.
    *   Screen titles and abstracts against inclusion/exclusion criteria.
    *   Retrieve full texts for potentially relevant articles.
    *   Screen full texts against criteria.
4.  **Extract Data & Assess Quality (if applicable):**
    *   For systematic reviews, develop a data extraction form to collect relevant information consistently (e.g., study design, participants, interventions, outcomes).
    *   Assess the quality or risk of bias of included studies using appropriate tools (e.g., Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, GRADE).
5.  **Synthesize Findings:**
    *   Organize and synthesize the information extracted from the included literature.
    *   Identify key themes, concepts, findings, conflicts, and gaps.
    *   Use tables or concept maps to visualize relationships.
    *   Perform meta-analysis if appropriate and feasible (for quantitative systematic reviews).
6.  **Write the Review:**
    *   Structure the review logically (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
    *   Clearly describe the search strategy and screening process (e.g., using a PRISMA flowchart for systematic reviews).
    *   Present the synthesized findings objectively.
    *   Discuss the implications of the findings, limitations of the review, and areas for future research.
    *   Ensure proper citation using a consistent style.

## 3. Best Practices

*   **Systematic Approach:** Follow a defined protocol, especially for systematic reviews.
*   **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of search strategies, screening decisions, and data extraction.
*   **Objectivity:** Strive for unbiased screening, data extraction, and synthesis.
*   **Collaboration:** Consider having multiple reviewers screen articles and extract data to reduce bias.
*   **Reference Management:** Use reference management software effectively.
*   **Stay Updated:** Literature evolves; consider setting up alerts for new publications.
