# Research Collaboration Model

This document outlines how the [[index|Research Unit]] collaborates with other units within the organization to maximize impact and ensure alignment.

## Key Collaboration Units

*   **[[../Development/|Development]]**: 
    *   **Input from Research**: Prototypes, technical specifications, feasibility studies, new algorithms.
    *   **Input to Research**: Technical challenges, platform constraints, implementation feedback, engineering support for experiments.
    *   **Mechanism**: Joint projects, regular sync meetings, shared tooling ([[Tools]]), embedded researchers/engineers.
*   **[[../Innovation/|Innovation]]**: 
    *   **Input from Research**: Identification of emerging trends, novel concepts, technology assessments.
    *   **Input to Research**: Strategic innovation themes, market insights, validation of potential applications.
    *   **Mechanism**: Innovation workshops, strategy alignment sessions, joint exploration of [[FocusAreas|new focus areas]].
*   **[[../ProductManagement/|Product Management]]**: 
    *   **Input from Research**: User research findings, technology capability insights, long-term trend analysis.
    *   **Input to Research**: Product roadmap needs, user pain points, market opportunities, feature validation requirements.
    *   **Mechanism**: Roadmap reviews, user research sharing sessions, market analysis collaboration.
*   **[[../Legal/|Legal]] & [[../Compliance/|Compliance]]**: 
    *   **Input from Research**: Need for IP protection (patents), ethical review requests, data usage questions.
    *   **Input to Research**: Guidance on IP strategy, compliance requirements (e.g., data privacy), ethical guidelines.
    *   **Mechanism**: Consultation requests, policy reviews ([[Policies/]]), joint review boards (e.g., [[../EthicsAdvisoryBoard/|Ethics Advisory Board]]).
*   **[[../Strategy/|Strategy]]**: 
    *   **Input from Research**: Long-term technological forecasts, competitive landscape analysis (tech-focused).
    *   **Input to Research**: Strategic priorities, alignment checks for [[FocusAreas|research themes]].
    *   **Mechanism**: Strategic planning sessions, input into [[../Strategy/Strategic Plan|Strategic Plan]].
*   **[[../Marketing/|Marketing]] & [[../MarketingCommunications/|Marketing Communications]]**: 
    *   **Input from Research**: White papers, technical articles, thought leadership content (based on [[Reports/]]).
    *   **Input to Research**: Market perception, communication strategy needs.
    *   **Mechanism**: Content planning meetings, review cycles for external communications.

## Collaboration Processes

*   **Project Initiation**: Clear definition of roles and contributions from collaborating units.
*   **Regular Check-ins**: Scheduled meetings based on project needs.
*   **Shared Documentation**: Utilizing common platforms (see [[Tools]]) for visibility.
*   **Knowledge Sharing**: Presentations, demos, contributions to the central knowledge base.
