# Defect Management Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

All defects identified during the lifecycle of products, services, or processes under the scope of the QA Unit must be logged, tracked, prioritized, assigned, resolved, and verified in a consistent and timely manner using the organization's standard defect tracking system.

## 2. Purpose

This policy establishes a standardized framework for managing defects. Its purpose is to ensure:
*   Visibility into product/service quality issues.
*   Effective communication regarding defects among stakeholders.
*   Prioritization of defect resolution based on impact and urgency.
*   Accountability for defect resolution.
*   Tracking of defect trends to inform process improvement.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all defects found during:
*   Any testing level (Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, Performance, Security, etc.).
*   Audits or reviews.
*   Operational monitoring (where applicable and routed to QA/Dev).
*   User feedback channels (once validated as a defect).

It applies to all teams involved in the defect lifecycle, including QA, Development, Product Management, Operations, and Support.

## 4. Defect Lifecycle & Statuses

A standard defect lifecycle with defined statuses must be used within the designated defect tracking tool. The typical lifecycle includes:

1.  **New/Open:** A potential defect has been identified and logged, pending review.
2.  **Assigned:** The defect has been reviewed, validated, and assigned to a team/individual for investigation/resolution.
3.  **In Progress:** The assigned team is actively working on fixing the defect.
4.  **Fixed/Resolved:** The developer has implemented a fix and checked it into the codebase.
5.  **Ready for Retest/Verification:** The fix has been deployed to a test environment, ready for QA verification.
6.  **Verified/Closed:** QA has confirmed the fix resolves the original issue and has not introduced regression issues. The defect is closed.
7.  **Reopened:** QA verification failed; the fix did not work or introduced new issues. The defect goes back to an earlier state (e.g., Assigned or In Progress).
8.  **Deferred/Postponed:** The decision has been made to not fix the defect in the current release/cycle.
9.  **Rejected/Not a Bug:** The logged issue is determined not to be a defect (e.g., works as designed, duplicate, misunderstanding).
10. **Duplicate:** The defect is a duplicate of an existing logged defect.

*(Note: Specific statuses may vary slightly based on the tool configuration, but the flow should be consistent.)*

## 5. Defect Logging Standard

All defect reports must include, at a minimum:
*   **Unique ID:** Generated by the tracking system.
*   **Summary/Title:** Clear, concise summary of the issue.
*   **Description:** Detailed description of the defect, including steps to reproduce.
*   **Environment:** OS, browser, hardware, software version, database, etc.
*   **Severity:** The impact of the defect on the system/user (see Section 6).
*   **Priority:** The urgency with which the defect needs to be fixed (see Section 7).
*   **Reported By & Date:** Who found the defect and when.
*   **Build/Version Found:** The specific version where the defect was identified.
*   **Component/Module:** The area of the system affected.
*   **Attachments:** Screenshots, logs, test data, etc.

## 6. Defect Severity Levels

Severity indicates the technical impact of the defect. Standard levels include:
*   **Critical/Blocker:** System crash, data loss/corruption, security breach, complete blockage of a major feature with no workaround.
*   **High/Major:** Major functionality failure, significant deviation from requirements, difficult workaround exists.
*   **Medium/Moderate:** Minor functionality failure, non-critical deviation, inconvenient workaround exists.
*   **Low/Minor:** Cosmetic issue, typo, usability suggestion, minimal impact on functionality.
*   **Trivial/Enhancement:** Lowest impact, often a suggestion for future improvement rather than a true defect.

*(Initial severity is set by the reporter, often QA, but may be reviewed/adjusted during triage.)*

## 7. Defect Priority Levels

Priority indicates the urgency of fixing the defect from a business/project perspective. Standard levels include:
*   **Urgent/Highest:** Must be fixed immediately or in the current build/sprint.
*   **High:** Must be fixed for the upcoming release.
*   **Medium:** Should be fixed if time/resources permit, potentially deferred.
*   **Low:** Desirable to fix, but can be deferred to future releases.

*(Priority is typically set during triage meetings involving QA, Development, and Product Management.)*

## 8. Defect Triage

Regular defect triage meetings should be held involving key stakeholders (QA Lead, Dev Lead, Product Owner/Manager) to:
*   Review newly logged defects.
*   Validate defects (confirm they are actual bugs).
*   Assign severity and priority.
*   Assign defects to the appropriate team/developer for resolution.
*   Decide on the resolution path (fix now, defer, reject).

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Reporter (QA, Dev, User, etc.):** Logs defects according to the standard.
*   **QA Team:** Verifies logged defects, participates in triage, verifies fixes, closes or reopens defects.
*   **Development Team:** Investigates assigned defects, implements fixes, updates defect status.
*   **Product Management/Owner:** Participates in triage, helps set priorities based on business value and impact.
*   **Triage Team:** Collectively reviews, prioritizes, and assigns defects.

## 10. Reporting

Defect metrics (e.g., total open defects, defect density, distribution by severity/priority, aging) will be tracked and reported regularly to monitor quality trends and inform decision-making.

## 11. Review and Revision

This policy and the associated defect management process will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.
