# Test Strategy Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

A consistent and risk-based testing strategy shall be applied to all applicable projects and services to ensure thorough quality verification, efficient resource utilization, and alignment with overall quality goals.

## 2. Purpose

This policy outlines the high-level principles and methodologies governing the testing activities performed by the QA Unit. It provides a framework for developing detailed test plans for specific projects or services, ensuring consistency and effectiveness in our testing efforts.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all testing activities performed by or under the oversight of the QA Unit, including but not limited to:
*   Software application testing (new development, enhancements, maintenance).
*   System integration testing.
*   Service validation.
*   Infrastructure change validation (where QA involvement is mandated).
*   Data migration testing.

## 4. Guiding Principles

*   **Risk-Based Testing:** Testing efforts will be prioritized based on the identified risks associated with requirements, features, components, or changes. Higher risk areas will receive more rigorous testing.
*   **Early Testing:** Testing activities should begin as early as possible in the development lifecycle (e.g., requirements review, static analysis, unit testing support) to detect defects sooner.
*   **Context-Driven:** The specific testing approach, techniques, and level of formality will be adapted based on the context of the project/service (e.g., complexity, risk level, technology, development methodology).
*   **Defect Prevention:** While defect detection is crucial, the strategy also emphasizes activities that help prevent defects (e.g., requirements clarity, process improvement).
*   **Automation:** Test automation will be strategically implemented for repetitive tasks (e.g., regression testing, performance testing) to improve efficiency, coverage, and consistency, where feasible and cost-effective.
*   **Clear Communication:** Test plans, progress, and results will be clearly communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The test strategy and underlying processes will be regularly reviewed and improved based on feedback and results.

## 5. Testing Levels

The following standard testing levels will be considered, as appropriate for the context:
*   **Unit Testing:** Typically performed by developers to verify individual components/modules.
*   **Integration Testing:** Testing the interfaces and interactions between integrated components or systems.
*   **System Testing:** Testing the entire integrated system against specified requirements.
*   **Acceptance Testing:** Formal testing conducted to determine if a system satisfies its acceptance criteria, often involving users or clients (UAT/BAT).
*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization under various loads.
*   **Security Testing:** Identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the system meets security requirements.
*   **Usability Testing:** Assessing the ease of use and user-friendliness of the application.
*   **Regression Testing:** Re-testing previously tested parts of the system following modifications to ensure that defects have not been introduced or uncovered in unchanged areas.

## 6. Test Environments

Appropriate test environments, representative of production where possible, must be established and maintained for effective testing. Configuration management practices should be applied to test environments.

## 7. Test Artifacts

Standard test artifacts will be produced and maintained, including:
*   Test Plan (Master Test Plan, Level-Specific Test Plans)
*   Test Cases / Test Scenarios
*   Test Data
*   Test Scripts (for automation)
*   Defect Reports
*   Test Summary Reports

Templates and standards for these artifacts will be maintained by the QA Unit.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **QA Unit:** Defines the overall test strategy, develops project/service-specific test plans, executes system/acceptance/performance/security/usability tests, manages test environments, reports on testing status and results.
*   **Development Teams:** Perform unit testing, support integration testing, fix defects identified during testing.
*   **Product/Service Owners:** Define acceptance criteria, participate in acceptance testing.
*   **Operations Teams:** Provide and support test environments.

## 9. Tools

The QA Unit will standardize on approved tools for test management, defect tracking, test automation, and performance testing to ensure consistency and efficiency.

## 10. Review and Revision

This policy will be reviewed annually by the QA Unit and updated as needed to align with industry best practices, new technologies, and organizational changes.
