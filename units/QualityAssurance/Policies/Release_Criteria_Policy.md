# Release Criteria Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

All products and services must meet defined, measurable, and agreed-upon release criteria before being deployed to production or released to customers, ensuring a minimum acceptable level of quality and readiness.

## 2. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for defining, evaluating, and approving the release readiness of products and services. Its purpose is to:
*   Ensure objectivity in the release decision-making process.
*   Minimize the risk of releasing products/services with unacceptable quality issues.
*   Provide clear quality gates for stakeholders.
*   Align release decisions with business objectives and risk tolerance.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all major releases, minor releases, patches, and hotfixes for software applications, systems, and services managed by the organization.

## 4. Core Release Criteria Categories

Release criteria must be defined for each project/product/service release plan and should cover, at a minimum, the following categories. Specific metrics and thresholds within these categories will vary based on context, risk, and requirements.

*   **Functionality:**
    *   All critical and high-priority requirements must be implemented and verified.
    *   Test case execution coverage: Minimum percentage of planned test cases executed (e.g., 100% for critical/high priority tests, 95% overall).
    *   Test case pass rate: Minimum percentage of executed test cases passed (e.g., 100% for critical/high priority tests, 98% overall).
*   **Defect Status:**
    *   No outstanding Critical/Blocker severity defects.
    *   Maximum number of open High severity defects (e.g., 0-2, depending on risk tolerance and impact, with documented workarounds and stakeholder approval).
    *   Maximum total number of open Medium/Low severity defects (threshold to be defined per release).
    *   Defect discovery rate trending downwards or stabilized.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization meet defined targets under expected load.
    *   Performance test results are stable and within acceptable limits.
*   **Security:**
    *   No outstanding critical or high-risk security vulnerabilities identified through scanning or penetration testing.
    *   All identified medium/low-risk vulnerabilities have a documented mitigation plan or acceptance of risk.
*   **Stability & Reliability:**
    *   System demonstrates stability during extended test runs (e.g., soak tests).
    *   No critical failures observed during the final testing phases (e.g., UAT, regression).
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Required user documentation (User Guides, Release Notes) is complete, reviewed, and approved.
    *   Required technical documentation (Deployment Guide, Operations Manual) is complete, reviewed, and approved.
*   **Deployment Readiness:**
    *   Deployment plan reviewed and approved.
    *   Rollback plan reviewed and approved.
    *   Operational readiness confirmed (monitoring, alerting, support procedures in place).
*   **Stakeholder Approval:**
    *   Successful completion of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with formal sign-off.
    *   Explicit sign-off from key stakeholders (e.g., Product Owner, QA Lead, Dev Lead, Operations Lead).

## 5. Defining Specific Criteria

For each release, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria based on the categories above must be documented in the Test Plan or a dedicated Release Readiness document. These criteria must be agreed upon by key stakeholders (QA, Development, Product Management, Operations) early in the release cycle.

## 6. Evaluation and Reporting

The QA Unit is responsible for tracking progress against the defined release criteria and reporting the status regularly. A final Release Readiness Review meeting should be held prior to the planned release date, where the QA Lead presents the evidence demonstrating whether the criteria have been met.

## 7. Decision Making

The release decision (Go/No-Go) is made based on the evaluation against the agreed criteria. Key stakeholders must formally approve the release.

*   **Go:** All criteria are met.
*   **Conditional Go:** Minor criteria are not fully met, but acceptable workarounds exist, risks are documented and accepted by stakeholders, and a plan is in place to address the deviations post-release. Requires explicit approval with documented exceptions.
*   **No-Go:** One or more critical criteria are not met. The release is postponed until the criteria are satisfied.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **QA Unit:** Defines category standards, facilitates definition of specific criteria per release, tracks and reports status, provides final QA recommendation/sign-off.
*   **Product Management/Owner:** Defines business requirements, prioritizes features/defects, participates in defining criteria, provides UAT sign-off and final release approval.
*   **Development Team:** Delivers features/fixes, supports testing, provides technical input for criteria, provides Dev sign-off.
*   **Operations Team:** Defines operational readiness criteria, confirms support procedures, provides Ops sign-off.
*   **Release Manager (if applicable):** Chairs the Release Readiness Review meeting, documents the final Go/No-Go decision.

## 9. Review and Revision

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in risk appetite, technology, or processes.
