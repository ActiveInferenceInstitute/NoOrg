# Quality Assurance Policies

This directory contains policies that govern the activities and standards of the Quality Assurance (QA) Unit.

## Policies:

*   **Quality_Standards_Policy.md:** Defines the baseline quality standards expected for all products, services, and processes.
*   **Test_Strategy_Policy.md:** Outlines the high-level approach to testing, including scope, methodologies, and environments.
*   **Defect_Management_Policy.md:** Specifies the process for identifying, logging, prioritizing, tracking, and resolving defects.
*   **Release_Criteria_Policy.md:** Defines the minimum quality criteria that must be met before a product or service can be released.

These policies are essential for maintaining consistency, ensuring thoroughness, and managing risk in our quality assurance efforts. All members of the QA team and relevant stakeholders are expected to be familiar with and adhere to these policies.
