# Quality Standards Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

All products, services, and associated processes developed or managed by the organization must meet established quality standards to ensure functionality, reliability, performance, security, usability, and maintainability, thereby maximizing customer satisfaction and minimizing operational risk.

## 2. Purpose

This policy defines the fundamental quality standards and attributes applicable across the organization. It serves as a baseline for specific project requirements, test plans, and quality audits, fostering a consistent understanding and application of quality principles.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:
*   All software development projects (internal and outsourced).
*   All operational services provided internally or externally.
*   All supporting documentation (technical, user, process).
*   Configuration management and deployment processes.
*   Data management and integrity.

## 4. Quality Attributes and Standards

The following quality attributes represent the core standards. Specific, measurable criteria for these attributes should be defined at the project or service level where applicable.

*   **Functionality:**
    *   The product/service performs all specified functions as documented in requirements.
    *   Accuracy: Calculations and data processing are correct.
    *   Interoperability: Integrates correctly with specified systems.
    *   Compliance: Adheres to relevant laws, standards, and guidelines.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   Maturity: Operates without failure for specified periods under normal conditions.
    *   Fault Tolerance: Handles errors and unexpected inputs gracefully.
    *   Recoverability: Can recover data and state after a failure.
*   **Performance Efficiency:**
    *   Time Behaviour: Responds within acceptable time limits under expected load.
    *   Resource Utilization: Uses system resources (CPU, memory, network) efficiently.
    *   Capacity: Can handle expected volumes of data and users.
*   **Security:**
    *   Confidentiality: Protects data from unauthorized access.
    *   Integrity: Prevents unauthorized modification of data or software.
    *   Non-repudiation: Actions can be traced back to their origin.
    *   Accountability: User actions are logged.
    *   Authenticity: Verifies the identity of users and systems.
    *   Compliance: Meets defined security standards and regulations (e.g., OWASP Top 10, GDPR).
*   **Usability:**
    *   Learnability: Easy for users to learn and operate.
    *   Operability: Interface is clear, intuitive, and controllable.
    *   User Error Protection: Minimizes the potential for user errors.
    *   Accessibility: Adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) where applicable.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   Modularity: Components are independent and replaceable.
    *   Reusability: Components can be reused in other systems.
    *   Analyzability: Easy to diagnose defects or identify parts needing modification.
    *   Modifiability: Easy to modify without introducing new defects.
    *   Testability: Easy to test and verify changes.
    *   Code Quality: Adheres to defined coding standards (e.g., style guides, commenting).
*   **Compatibility:**
    *   Co-existence: Operates alongside other software in a shared environment without adverse effects.
    *   Interoperability (Reiteration): Exchanges information correctly with other specified systems.
*   **Portability:**
    *   Adaptability: Can be adapted for use in different environments (OS, browsers, hardware).
    *   Installability: Can be installed/deployed easily in specified environments.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **QA Unit:** Responsible for defining, promoting, and verifying adherence to these standards through testing and auditing. Develops specific metrics and test procedures.
*   **Development Teams:** Responsible for designing and building products/services that meet these standards. Implement unit and integration testing.
*   **Product/Service Owners:** Responsible for defining functional requirements and acceptance criteria that align with these standards.
*   **Operations Teams:** Responsible for maintaining the operational environment to support reliability and performance standards.

## 6. Measurement and Verification

Adherence to quality standards will be measured and verified through:
*   Requirement reviews.
*   Design reviews.
*   Code reviews.
*   Static code analysis.
*   Unit, integration, system, performance, security, and acceptance testing.
*   Quality audits.
*   Monitoring of production systems.
*   Analysis of customer feedback and defect reports.

## 7. Policy Enforcement

Non-compliance with this policy may result in delayed releases, required remediation efforts, or escalation to management. The QA Unit has the authority to flag non-conformance based on evidence gathered during verification activities.

## 8. Review and Revision

This policy will be reviewed annually by the QA Unit and relevant stakeholders and updated as necessary to reflect evolving technologies, methodologies, and organizational needs.
