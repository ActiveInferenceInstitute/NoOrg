# Quality Audit Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

The Quality Assurance (QA) Unit will conduct periodic, independent quality audits of key processes, projects, and systems to verify compliance with established standards, policies, and procedures, and to identify opportunities for improvement.

## 2. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for planning, conducting, reporting, and following up on internal quality audits performed by the QA Unit. The purpose of these audits is to:
*   Provide objective assurance that quality requirements and standards are being met.
*   Verify the effectiveness of quality control processes.
*   Identify non-conformances, risks, and areas for process improvement.
*   Promote a culture of continuous quality improvement.
*   Ensure compliance with relevant internal policies and external regulations/standards.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to internal quality audits conducted by the QA Unit covering areas such as:
*   Software development lifecycle processes (e.g., requirements management, design, coding, testing, deployment).
*   Project management practices related to quality.
*   Operational procedures impacting service quality.
*   Compliance with specific quality standards (defined in `Quality_Standards_Policy.md`).
*   Adherence to QA policies and procedures themselves.

This policy does not typically cover financial audits or audits performed by external regulatory bodies, although the QA Unit may provide support or evidence for such audits.

## 4. Audit Principles

Quality audits conducted under this policy will adhere to the following principles:
*   **Independence:** Auditors should be independent of the specific activity or area being audited to ensure objectivity.
*   **Objectivity:** Findings and conclusions must be based on verifiable evidence.
*   **Confidentiality:** Audit findings and sensitive information gathered during the audit will be handled with appropriate confidentiality.
*   **Systematic Approach:** Audits will be planned, conducted, and reported in a structured and consistent manner.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Audit findings will be supported by documented evidence (e.g., records, interviews, observations).
*   **Professional Due Care:** Auditors will possess the necessary skills and knowledge and conduct the audit with diligence.
