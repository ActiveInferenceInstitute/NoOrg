# Test Automation Process

## Overview

The Test Automation Process defines the approach, tools, and methodology for implementing and maintaining automated tests across our products and services. Automation reduces manual testing effort, increases test coverage, enables frequent regression testing, and provides rapid feedback on software quality.

## Automation Framework Selection Criteria

1. **Compatibility** with technologies used in the product
2. **Scalability** to handle growing test suites
3. **Maintainability** with clear patterns and organization
4. **Integration** with existing development and QA tools
5. **Community support** and documentation availability
6. **Skill alignment** with the QA team's capabilities

## Process Steps

### 1. Test Case Selection for Automation

- Review manual test cases for automation candidates based on:
  - Execution frequency
  - Test stability
  - Technical feasibility
  - Business criticality
  - Regression risk
- Document selected test cases in the automation backlog
- Prioritize based on risk assessment and effort estimation

### 2. Test Automation Architecture Design

- Define the automation framework structure:
  - Page Object Model or appropriate design pattern
  - Folder organization and naming conventions
  - Reporting mechanism
  - Test data management approach
  - Environment configuration handling
- Document the architecture in the automation framework guide

### 3. Development Process

- Create automated test scripts following the framework guidelines
- Implement with proper:
  - Error handling
  - Logging and reporting
  - Assertions and validations
  - Exception management
  - Retry mechanisms for flaky operations
- Conduct code review of test scripts by at least one other QA engineer
- Validate test scripts work across all required environments

### 4. Integration with CI/CD

- Configure automated tests to run:
  - On code commits (smoke tests)
  - At scheduled intervals (regression suites)
  - Before deployment to staging/production environments
- Integrate results with notification systems
- Link test results to relevant work items and defects

### 5. Maintenance

- Scheduled review of:
  - Test failures and root causes
  - Test execution time
  - Code coverage metrics
  - False positives/negatives
- Refactor tests when application changes impact existing scripts
- Document known limitations and workarounds

## Reporting and Metrics

- Track key automation metrics:
  - Automation coverage (% of test cases automated)
  - Pass/fail rates and trends
  - Execution time
  - Defects found by automated tests
- Generate [[../Reports/Automation_Coverage_Report_Template|Automation Coverage Reports]] quarterly

## Tools and Resources

- Test automation frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright)
- Test management tools
- CI/CD integration tools
- Version control for test code
- Code quality tools for test code
