# Test Planning Process

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the standard process for creating a Test Plan for a project, release, or significant feature. The Test Plan serves as the central document guiding all testing activities, ensuring adequate coverage, resource allocation, and risk mitigation.

## 2. Scope

This process applies whenever formal testing is required, as defined by the [[../Policies/Test_Strategy_Policy|Test Strategy Policy]]. It typically involves the [[../index|QA Lead/Manager]], assigned QA Engineer(s), and consultation with [[../../Development/index|Development Lead(s)]] and [[../../ProductManagement/index|Product Owner(s)/Manager(s)]].

## 3. Process Steps

1.  **Initiation & Input Gathering:**
    *   Trigger: New project kickoff, release planning, significant feature development.
    *   Inputs: Project charter, requirements documents (functional specifications, user stories, acceptance criteria), design documents, [[../../RiskManagement/index|risk assessments]], [[../Policies/Test_Strategy_Policy|Test Strategy Policy]], [[../Policies/Quality_Standards_Policy|Quality Standards Policy]].
    *   Action: QA Lead/Engineer reviews input documents to understand the scope, objectives, and potential risks.
2.  **Scope Definition & Risk Analysis:**
    *   Action: Define precisely what features/functions/non-functional aspects are in scope for testing and what is out of scope.
    *   Action: Conduct a [[../../RiskManagement/index|risk analysis]] to identify areas requiring more intensive testing (e.g., complex features, critical functions, new technology, areas with historical defects).
    *   Output: List of features in scope, list of features out of scope, risk assessment matrix/summary.
3.  **Test Strategy & Approach Definition:**
    *   Action: Based on scope, risks, and the overall [[../Policies/Test_Strategy_Policy|Test Strategy Policy]], define the specific testing levels (Unit, Integration, System, UAT, Performance, Security, etc.) to be employed.
    *   Action: Determine testing techniques (e.g., exploratory testing, boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, usability testing).
    *   Action: Define the approach for test automation (what to automate, tools, framework).
    *   Action: Identify required test environments and data needs.
    *   Output: High-level testing approach documented.
4.  **Define Test Objectives & Criteria:**
    *   Action: Define clear, measurable objectives for the testing effort (e.g., achieve X% requirements coverage, find Y critical defects before UAT).
    *   Action: Define entry criteria (conditions that must be met before testing can begin, e.g., build deployed, smoke test passed).
    *   Action: Define exit criteria (conditions that must be met to consider testing complete, aligned with [[../Policies/Release_Criteria_Policy|Release Criteria Policy]], e.g., test coverage achieved, defect density below threshold, no outstanding critical defects).
    *   Action: Define suspension and resumption criteria (conditions under which testing will be paused and resumed).
    *   Output: Documented objectives, entry/exit/suspension/resumption criteria.
5.  **Resource Planning & Scheduling:**
    *   Action: Identify required QA resources (personnel, tools, hardware).
    *   Action: Estimate the effort required for test design, execution, automation, and reporting.
    *   Action: Develop a high-level schedule for testing activities, aligning with the overall project/release timeline.
    *   Output: Resource allocation plan, effort estimates, testing schedule.
6.  **Define Test Deliverables:**
    *   Action: List the specific documents and artifacts that will be produced during the testing process (e.g., Test Plan, Test Cases, Test Scripts, Defect Reports, Test Summary Report).
    *   Output: List of test deliverables.
7.  **Draft Test Plan Document:**
    *   Action: Consolidate all the information gathered and defined in the previous steps into a formal Test Plan document using the standard template.
    *   Output: Draft Test Plan.
8.  **Review and Approval:**
    *   Action: Circulate the draft Test Plan to key stakeholders (e.g., QA Lead, Dev Lead, Product Owner, Project Manager) for review and feedback.
    *   Action: Incorporate feedback and revise the Test Plan as needed.
    *   Action: Obtain formal sign-off/approval from designated stakeholders.
    *   Output: Approved Test Plan.
9.  **Communication:**
    *   Action: Communicate the approved Test Plan to the project team and relevant stakeholders.
    *   Action: Store the Test Plan in the designated central repository.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **[[../index|QA Lead/Manager]]:** Oversees the process, reviews/approves Test Plan, allocates resources.
*   **[[../index|QA Engineer(s)]]:** Gathers inputs, performs analysis, drafts the Test Plan, incorporates feedback.
*   **[[../../Development/index|Development Lead]]:** Provides technical input, reviews Test Plan for feasibility.
*   **[[../../ProductManagement/index|Product Owner/Manager]]:** Provides requirements clarification, reviews Test Plan for coverage, approves scope and criteria.
*   **Project Manager:** Provides project context, reviews schedule and resource plan.

## 6. Inputs

*   Project Charter / Requirements Documents
*   Design Specifications
*   [[../../RiskManagement/index|Risk Assessments]]
