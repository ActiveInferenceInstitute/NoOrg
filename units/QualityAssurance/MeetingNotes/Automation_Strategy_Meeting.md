## 1. Current Automation Status Overview

Jamie presented current automation metrics:
- Overall test automation coverage: 62%
- Unit test coverage: 78%
- API test coverage: 65%
- UI test coverage: 42%
- Performance test automation: 55%
- Current execution time for full regression: 4.5 hours

Key challenges:
- Flaky UI tests (~15% of tests fail intermittently)
- Maintenance overhead taking ~40% of automation team time
- Limited mobile testing automation
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline needs improvement

## 2. Challenges and Pain Points

Team discussion identified these primary challenges:
- **Test Environment Stability**: Inconsistent test environments causing false failures
- **Test Data Management**: Lack of automated test data setup and teardown
- **Skill Gaps**: Limited expertise in mobile automation and performance testing
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Using multiple tools without clear guidelines
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy test scripts need refactoring for maintainability
- **Reporting**: Lack of unified reporting across different test types

## 3. Strategic Goals for Next 12 Months

The team agreed on these strategic goals:
1. Increase overall test automation coverage to 80%
2. Reduce full regression execution time to under 2 hours
3. Decrease test maintenance overhead to less than 20% of team time
4. Achieve 99% stability in automated tests (less than 1% flaky tests)
5. Implement comprehensive mobile test automation framework
6. Seamless integration with CI/CD pipeline, with quality gates
7. Automated environment provisioning and test data management

## 4. Framework Evaluation and Selection

The team evaluated these frameworks for different testing needs:

### UI Testing
- Current: Selenium WebDriver with custom framework
- Alternatives discussed: Cypress, Playwright
- **Decision**: Migrate to Playwright due to better cross-browser support, performance, and modern architecture

### API Testing
- Current: RestAssured and custom scripts
- Alternatives discussed: Postman/Newman, Karate DSL
- **Decision**: Standardize on Karate DSL for new API tests, gradual migration from RestAssured

### Mobile Testing
- Current: Limited Appium usage
- Alternatives discussed: Detox, XCUITest + Espresso
- **Decision**: Implement Appium with improved architecture for cross-platform testing

### Performance Testing
- Current: JMeter
- Alternatives discussed: k6, Gatling
- **Decision**: Continue with JMeter, explore k6 for microservices performance testing

## 5. Resource Planning and Training Needs

Current team composition:
- 3 automation engineers (2 web-focused, 1 API-focused)
- 6 manual QA engineers with basic automation skills
- 1 performance engineer

Resource plan:
- Convert 2 manual QA roles to automation specialists over 6 months
- Hire 1 mobile automation specialist
- Provide training to upskill manual QA engineers

Training needs:
- Playwright workshop for all QA team members
- Karate DSL training for API testing
- Mobile automation fundamentals course
- Advanced CI/CD for QA professionals course

## 6. Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

Current state:
- Basic test execution in CI pipeline
- Manual approval gates
- Limited feedback to developers

Target state:
- Automated test selection based on code changes
- Parallel test execution in the pipeline
- Automated quality gates with clear pass/fail criteria
- Immediate feedback to developers with detailed reports
- Test environments provisioned automatically

**Actions:**
- Taylor to work with Jamie on CI pipeline improvements
- Implement containerized test environments
- Develop quality gates based on [[../Policies/Release_Criteria_Policy|Release Criteria Policy]]

## 7. Metrics and Reporting

Current metrics:
- Pass/fail rates
- Code coverage
- Execution time

New metrics to implement:
- Defect detection effectiveness
- Coverage by feature risk
- Test stability metrics
- Automation ROI calculation
- Time saved compared to manual testing

Reporting improvements:
- Create [[../Reports/Automation_Coverage_Report_Template|standardized reporting template]]
- Automated dashboard with real-time results
- Integration with project management tools
- Trend analysis over time

## 8. Next Steps

| Action Item | Owner | Due Date |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Finalize framework selection with POCs | Jamie | Apr 24 |
| Develop migration strategy from current frameworks | Jamie, Jordan | May 1 |
| Create training plan for team | Alex | Apr 30 |
| Design new CI pipeline integration architecture | Taylor, Jamie | May 15 |
| Develop test data management solution | Morgan | Jun 1 |

## Decisions Made

1. Migrate UI automation to Playwright framework
2. Standardize API testing on Karate DSL
3. Expand mobile automation using improved Appium implementation
4. Continue with JMeter for performance testing, explore k6
5. Convert 2 manual QA roles to automation specialists
6. Hire 1 mobile automation specialist
7. Implement containerized test environments
8. Develop comprehensive automation dashboard

## Next Meeting
