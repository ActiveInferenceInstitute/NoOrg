# Development Unit Policies

## Overview
This document outlines key policies governing the Development unit's software engineering, product development, and technical operations. These policies ensure quality, consistency, security, and efficiency in the development lifecycle.

## Core Policy Areas

### 1. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **[[sdlc_policy]]**: Defines the standard phases, methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum), and required deliverables for software development projects.
- **[[version_control_policy]]**: Mandates the use of the designated version control system (e.g., Git) and outlines branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow) and commit message standards.
- **[[code_review_policy]]**: Requirements for peer code reviews, including scope, process, and tool usage.
- **[[release_management_policy]]**: Procedures for planning, scheduling, testing, and deploying software releases.

### 2. Coding Standards and Quality
- **[[coding_standards_policy]]**: Defines language-specific coding conventions, style guides, and best practices.
- **[[code_documentation_policy]]**: Requirements for in-line comments, README files, and API documentation.
- **[[testing_policy]]**: Mandates different levels of testing (unit, integration, E2E), code coverage minimums, and test automation practices.
- **[[technical_debt_management_policy]]**: Guidelines for identifying, tracking, and prioritizing the reduction of technical debt.

### 3. Security
- **[[secure_coding_policy]]**: Mandates secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and the use of security analysis tools.
- **[[dependency_management_policy]]**: Procedures for selecting, vetting, and updating third-party libraries and dependencies.
- **[[data_handling_policy]]**: Guidelines for handling sensitive data within development and testing environments (in coordination with [[Security]] and [[Compliance]]).

### 4. Infrastructure and Operations
- **[[environment_management_policy]]**: Defines standards for development, testing, staging, and production environments.
- **[[infrastructure_as_code_policy]]**: Guidelines for managing infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
- **[[monitoring_and_logging_policy]]**: Requirements for implementing application monitoring, logging, and alerting.

### 5. Tools and Technology
- **[[technology_stack_policy]]**: Guidelines for selecting and approving programming languages, frameworks, and core technologies.
- **[[development_tooling_policy]]**: Standards for required development tools (IDE, build tools, CI/CD platform).

## Compliance and Review
Policies are reviewed periodically and updated as needed. Adherence is mandatory for all development team members and contractors.
