# Development Unit Reports

## Overview
This document describes the standard reports generated and utilized by the Development unit to track project progress, monitor code quality, measure team velocity, and assess system performance.

## Key Report Types

### 1. Project and Sprint Tracking Reports (Agile/Scrum)
- **[[sprint_burndown_chart]]**: Visualizes the completion of work within a sprint against the planned timeline.
    - *Frequency: Daily/Per Sprint*
    - *Audience: Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner*
- **[[release_burndown_chart]]**: Tracks the overall progress towards a larger release across multiple sprints.
    - *Frequency: Per Sprint/Monthly*
    - *Audience: Development Leadership, Product Management, Stakeholders*
- **[[velocity_report]]**: Shows the amount of work (e.g., story points) completed by a team per sprint over time.
    - *Frequency: Per Sprint/Quarterly*
    - *Audience: Development Team, Scrum Master, Development Leadership*
- **[[cumulative_flow_diagram]]**: Visualizes the flow of work items through different stages of the development process.
    - *Frequency: Continuous/Per Sprint*
    - *Audience: Development Team, Scrum Master, Development Leadership*

### 2. Code Quality and Testing Reports
- **[[code_coverage_report]]**: Shows the percentage of code lines covered by automated tests.
    - *Frequency: Per Build/Per Release*
    - *Audience: Development Team, Development Leadership, QA*
- **[[static_analysis_report]]**: Lists potential code quality issues, bugs, and style violations identified by static analysis tools.
    - *Frequency: Per Build/Per Pull Request*
    - *Audience: Development Team*
- **[[test_results_summary]]**: Summarizes the results of automated test runs (unit, integration, E2E).
    - *Frequency: Per Build/Per Release*
    - *Audience: Development Team, QA, Development Leadership*
- **[[bug_density_report]]**: Tracks the number of bugs found per feature or per lines of code.
    - *Frequency: Per Release/Quarterly*
    - *Audience: Development Leadership, QA*

### 3. CI/CD and Deployment Reports
- **[[build_status_report]]**: Shows the success/failure rate and duration of automated builds.
    - *Frequency: Continuous/Daily*
    - *Audience: Development Team, DevOps/Platform Team*
- **[[deployment_frequency_report]]**: Tracks how often code is successfully deployed to production.
    - *Frequency: Monthly/Quarterly*
    - *Audience: Development Leadership, DevOps/Platform Team*
- **[[change_fail_rate_report]]**: Measures the percentage of deployments that result in production failures or require hotfixes.
    - *Frequency: Monthly/Quarterly*
    - *Audience: Development Leadership, DevOps/Platform Team*

### 4. System Performance and Reliability Reports
- **[[application_performance_monitoring_(apm)_report]]**: Summarizes key application performance metrics (response time, error rates, throughput).
    - *Frequency: Continuous/Daily/Weekly*
    - *Audience: Development Team, Operations/SRE, Development Leadership*
- **[[system_uptime_report]]**: Tracks the availability and uptime of production systems.
    - *Frequency: Monthly/Quarterly*
    - *Audience: Development Leadership, Operations/SRE, Stakeholders*

## Report Access and Distribution
Reports are generated from various sources including [[project_management_tool]] (e.g., Jira), [[version_control_system]] (e.g., Gitlab/Github), [[ci_cd_platform]], [[testing_frameworks]], and [[monitoring_systems]]. Access is typically provided via dashboards or automated summaries.
