# Development Unit Charter

## 1. Mission Statement
To engineer, deliver, and maintain high-quality, scalable, and secure software solutions and platforms that meet the needs of the organization and its customers, fostering innovation and technical excellence.

## 2. Scope and Authority
The Development unit is responsible for the entire lifecycle of software development, including:
- Design, architecture, and technical specification of software systems.
- Implementation (coding) of features, enhancements, and bug fixes.
- Unit and integration testing.
- Collaboration with [[QualityAssurance]] for comprehensive testing.
- Building, deploying, and releasing software to various environments.
- Maintaining and supporting deployed applications and platforms.
- Defining and enforcing coding standards, development processes, and tooling.
- Managing source code repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
- Evaluating and adopting new technologies and frameworks relevant to development.
- Managing technical debt and ensuring system health.

The unit has the authority to establish technical direction, select appropriate technologies (within defined governance), and manage development resources for approved projects and products. It operates under the guidance of the [[Chief Technology Officer (CTO)]] or equivalent leadership.

## 3. Core Responsibilities
- **Software Engineering**: Design, develop, and test software according to requirements and quality standards.
- **Architecture**: Define and maintain the overall structure and technical integrity of software systems.
- **Technical Innovation**: Research, evaluate, and propose new technologies to improve products or processes.
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement unit/integration tests and collaborate with QA to ensure product quality.
- **DevOps/Platform Engineering**: Build and manage CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and deployment processes (or collaborate closely with a dedicated [[DevOps]]/[[Platform]] team).
- **Maintenance & Support**: Address bugs, performance issues, and provide technical support for operational systems (often in coordination with [[Operations]]/[[SRE]]).
- **Process Adherence**: Follow established SDLC, Agile methodologies, and engineering best practices.
- **Collaboration**: Work closely with [[ProductManagement]] on requirements, [[UX/UI Design]] on user experience, [[QA]] on testing, [[Operations]]/[[SRE]] on deployment and reliability, and [[Security]] on secure development.
- **Mentorship & Growth**: Foster a culture of learning, knowledge sharing, and professional development within the engineering team.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Development Velocity/Throughput**: Rate of delivery of features/story points.
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Code coverage, static analysis results, bug density.
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from code commit to production deployment.
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often code is deployed to production.
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing production issues.
- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**: Time taken to recover from production failures.
- **System Uptime/Reliability**: Availability of key systems.
- **Sprint Goal Achievement**: (Agile) Percentage of sprint goals met.
- **Technical Debt Level**: Monitored trends in identified technical debt.

## 5. Interfaces
- **Internal**: [[ProductManagement]], [[UX/UI Design]], [[QualityAssurance]], [[Operations]]/[[SRE]], [[Security]], [[DataScience]]/[[Analytics]], [[IT Support]], [[ProjectManagementOffice (PMO)]], [[Executive Leadership]].
- **External**: Third-party library maintainers, cloud service providers, technical communities, potential recruits.

## 6. Governance and Review
This charter is subject to annual review and approval by the [[CTO]] or equivalent executive sponsor. The [[Head of Development]] (or equivalent role, e.g., VP Engineering) is responsible for the execution of this charter, managing the development teams, and ensuring alignment with organizational goals.
