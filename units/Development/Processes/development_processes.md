# Development Unit Processes

## Overview
This document details the standard processes followed by the Development unit throughout the software development lifecycle, from planning and coding to testing and deployment.

## Core Processes

### 1. Planning and Design
- **[[requirements_gathering_process]]**: Steps for collaborating with [[ProductManagement]] to understand and refine feature requirements.
- **[[technical_design_process]]**: Procedure for creating technical design documents, including architecture diagrams and API specifications.
- **[[sprint_planning_process]]**: (Agile/Scrum) Steps for planning work for upcoming sprints, including estimation and task breakdown.
- **[[backlog_grooming_process]]**: (Agile/Scrum) Ongoing process for refining and prioritizing the product backlog.

### 2. Development Workflow
- **[[branching_and_merging_process]]**: Standard workflow for creating feature branches, developing code, and merging back (e.g., using pull/merge requests).
- **[[commit_process]]**: Guidelines for writing meaningful commit messages and frequency of commits.
- **[[code_review_process]]**: Steps for requesting, performing, and addressing feedback from code reviews.
- **[[local_development_setup_process]]**: Instructions for setting up a consistent local development environment.

### 3. Build and Integration
- **[[continuous_integration_process]]**: Automated process for building code, running unit tests, and performing static analysis upon code commits.
- **[[dependency_update_process]]**: Procedure for regularly checking and updating third-party dependencies.

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **[[unit_testing_process]]**: Developer process for writing and running unit tests for their code.
- **[[integration_testing_process]]**: Steps for testing the interaction between different modules or services.
- **[[end_to_end_testing_process]]**: Process for testing complete user workflows (often automated).
- **[[bug_reporting_process]]**: Standard procedure for reporting, triaging, and tracking bugs found during testing or in production.
- **[[qa_handoff_process]]**: Procedure for handing over features or builds to the [[QualityAssurance]] team (if applicable).

### 5. Deployment and Release
- **[[deployment_to_staging_process]]**: Steps for deploying code changes to a pre-production (staging) environment for validation.
- **[[production_release_process]]**: Coordinated steps for deploying code to the production environment, including rollback plans.
- **[[hotfix_process]]**: Expedited procedure for developing, testing, and deploying urgent fixes to production issues.
- **[[post_release_monitoring_process]]**: Activities performed immediately after a release to ensure stability and performance.

## Process Improvement
Development processes are continuously evaluated based on team retrospectives, metrics, and feedback. Suggestions for improvement can be raised within teams or directed to [[development_leadership]].
