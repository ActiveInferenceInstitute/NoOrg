## 3. Policy Statements

*   **Business Continuity Planning (BCP):** The organization will maintain a Business Continuity Plan that identifies critical business functions, dependencies, and strategies for maintaining operations during a disruption.
*   **Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning:** The IT Department will maintain a Disaster Recovery Plan detailing the procedures to recover IT infrastructure and data at an alternate site or using alternative technologies following a disaster.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Regular risk assessments will be conducted to identify potential threats (natural disasters, cyberattacks, power failures, etc.) and their potential impact on IT systems and business operations.
*   **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** A BIA will be maintained to identify critical business processes and associated IT systems, define Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
    *   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable downtime for a system or function.
    *   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time.
*   **Recovery Strategies:** Appropriate recovery strategies (e.g., data backups, redundant systems, cloud-based recovery, alternate site) will be implemented based on BIA results, RTOs, and RPOs.
*   **Data Backup and Restoration:** Robust data backup procedures must be in place for critical data, with regular testing of data restoration capabilities.
*   **DR Site:** If applicable, an alternate recovery site (hot, warm, or cold) will be maintained and tested.
*   **Plan Maintenance and Testing:** Both the BCP and DR plans will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or following significant changes to the IT environment or business operations. Regular testing (e.g., tabletop exercises, failover tests) will be conducted to validate the plans' effectiveness.
*   **Emergency Response Team:** A designated team will be responsible for activating and coordinating the BCP/DR plans during an incident.
