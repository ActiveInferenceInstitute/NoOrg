## 3. Password Construction Requirements

All user passwords must meet the following minimum complexity requirements:

*   **Minimum Length:** [Specify minimum length, e.g., 12 or 14 characters]
*   **Complexity:** Must include characters from at least three of the following four categories:
    *   Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    *   Lowercase letters (a-z)
    *   Numbers (0-9)

*   **Prohibited Content:** Passwords must not contain:
    *   Username or parts of the username.
    *   Common dictionary words.
    *   Repetitive characters (e.g., 'aaaaaa') or sequential characters (e.g., '12345', 'abcde').
    *   Personal information (e.g., names, birthdates, addresses).
    *   Company name or abbreviations.

## 4. Password Change Frequency

*   User passwords must be changed at least every [Specify number, e.g., 90] days.
*   Users will be prompted to change their passwords before expiration.

## 5. Password History

## 6. Password Protection

*   Users must not share their passwords with anyone, including IT staff or managers.
*   Passwords must not be written down or stored electronically in an unsecured format (e.g., plain text files, spreadsheets, sticky notes).
*   Users must lock their workstations or log out when leaving them unattended.
*   Users should be suspicious of any communication asking for their password.
*   Use of password managers is encouraged for managing unique, complex passwords.

## 7. Initial Passwords and Resets

*   Default or temporary passwords assigned by IT must be changed by the user upon first login.

## 11. Enforcement

*   Compliance with this policy is mandatory.
*   Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action and revocation of access privileges.
*   Systems will be configured to enforce password complexity, history, and expiration rules.

## 12. Policy Review
