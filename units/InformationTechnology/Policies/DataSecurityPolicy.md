# Data Security Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Last Reviewed:** [Date]

## 1. Purpose

To establish guidelines and controls for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's data assets.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all organizational data, regardless of format (electronic, paper) or location (on-premises servers, cloud services, endpoints, removable media), and to all personnel (employees, contractors, third parties) who access or handle this data.

## 3. Data Classification

*   Organizational data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality (e.g., Public, Internal Use, Confidential, Restricted).
*   A data classification scheme and handling requirements for each level will be defined and maintained [Link to Data Classification Standard if separate].
*   Data owners are responsible for classifying the data under their stewardship.

## 4. Access Control

*   Access to organizational data and systems will be based on the principle of least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC).
*   User access rights must be formally requested, approved by the data owner or designated authority, and implemented by IT.
*   Access privileges will be reviewed regularly (e.g., quarterly, annually) and revoked or adjusted upon changes in job role or termination.
*   Strong authentication methods, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) where appropriate, must be used to access sensitive data and systems (Refer to [Password Policy] and [Remote Access Policy]).

## 5. Data Handling and Storage

*   **Sensitive Data:** Specific controls must be applied when handling sensitive or restricted data, including:
    *   Encryption at rest and in transit.
    *   Prohibition of storage on unapproved devices or services (e.g., personal devices, public cloud storage unless explicitly approved and secured).
    *   Secure transmission methods.
    *   Restrictions on printing or copying.
*   **Removable Media:** Use of removable media (USB drives, external hard drives) for storing or transporting sensitive data must be minimized, require approval, and media must be encrypted.
*   **Physical Security:** Physical access to areas containing sensitive data (data centers, file rooms) must be restricted.

## 6. Data Encryption

*   Encryption must be used to protect sensitive data:
    *   **At Rest:** On servers, databases, laptops, mobile devices, and removable media.
    *   **In Transit:** Over public networks (internet) and internal networks where appropriate (e.g., using TLS/SSL, VPNs).
*   Approved encryption standards and key management practices must be followed.

## 7. Data Backup and Recovery

*   Critical organizational data must be backed up regularly according to defined schedules.
*   Backup media must be stored securely, potentially offsite.
*   Backup restoration procedures must be tested periodically to ensure data recoverability (Refer to [Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Policy]).

## 8. Data Retention and Disposal

*   Data will be retained only as long as required for business, legal, or regulatory purposes, as defined in the [Data Retention Schedule/Policy].
*   Data designated for disposal must be securely destroyed or erased, rendering it unrecoverable.
    *   Electronic media must be sanitized using approved methods (e.g., cryptographic erasure, physical destruction).
    *   Paper documents must be shredded or securely disposed of.

## 9. Third-Party Security

*   Third parties granted access to organizational data must adhere to equivalent security standards.
*   Security requirements must be included in contracts with third-party vendors handling organizational data.
*   Due diligence must be performed on third-party security practices.

## 10. Security Awareness and Training

*   All personnel handling organizational data will receive regular security awareness training covering data protection responsibilities and threats.

## 11. Incident Response

*   Suspected data breaches or security incidents must be reported immediately according to the [Incident Response Policy].

## 12. Enforcement

*   Violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and potential legal consequences.
*   Compliance will be monitored through audits and system logging.

## 13. Policy Review

*   This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to address evolving threats, technologies, and regulations.
