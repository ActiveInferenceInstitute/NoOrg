# Remote Access Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Last Reviewed:** [Date]

## 1. Purpose

To establish guidelines and security requirements for accessing the organization's network and resources remotely.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and authorized third parties who remotely access the organization's internal network, systems, or data.

## 3. Authorization

*   Remote access privileges must be requested and formally approved based on job role and business need.
*   Access levels will be granted based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Remote access authorization will be reviewed periodically and revoked upon termination of employment or contract, or when access is no longer required.

## 4. Approved Methods

*   Remote access must be established using organization-approved methods only, such as:
    *   Virtual Private Network (VPN) client provided by the IT Department.
    *   Secure remote desktop solutions (e.g., RDP Gateway, VDI) managed by the IT Department.
    *   Other methods explicitly approved by the IT Department.
*   Use of unauthorized remote access software or methods is strictly prohibited.

## 5. Security Requirements for Remote Devices

Devices (whether organization-owned or personal/BYOD if permitted) used for remote access must meet the following minimum security requirements:

*   **Operating System:** Must be a supported OS version with the latest security patches installed.
*   **Anti-Malware:** Must have organization-approved anti-malware software installed, running, and up-to-date.
*   **Firewall:** A host-based firewall must be enabled.
*   **Encryption:** Full disk encryption may be required for devices storing sensitive organizational data.
*   **Password/Authentication:** Device access must be protected by a strong password or biometric authentication, and configured to lock after a period of inactivity.
*   **Updates:** Users are responsible for ensuring their device's OS and software are kept reasonably up-to-date.
*   The organization reserves the right to scan remote devices connecting via VPN for compliance with security requirements.

## 6. User Responsibilities

*   Users are responsible for ensuring the physical security of devices used for remote access.
*   Users must not allow unauthorized individuals (including family members) to use their credentials or access organizational resources via their remote connection.
*   Remote work environments should be reasonably secure to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information (e.g., avoid working on sensitive data in public places).
*   Users must connect only through trusted and secure networks (e.g., avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks unless using VPN).
*   Users must log off or disconnect remote sessions when finished.
*   Lost or stolen devices used for remote access must be reported immediately to the IT Department.

## 7. Data Security

*   Sensitive or confidential organizational data should not be stored locally on personal/BYOD devices used for remote access, unless explicitly permitted and secured according to organizational standards (e.g., encryption, approved cloud storage).
*   Transferring organizational data to personal storage media (USB drives, personal cloud accounts) is generally prohibited.

## 8. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   MFA is required for all remote access connections to the organization's network.

## 9. Monitoring

*   Remote access activities may be logged and monitored for security and operational purposes.

## 10. Enforcement

*   Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, and revocation of remote access privileges.

## 11. Policy Review

*   This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
