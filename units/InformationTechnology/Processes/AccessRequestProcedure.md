3.  **Approval Workflow:**  
    *   **Manager Approval:** Request is routed to the user's manager for initial approval.
    *   **Resource Owner Approval:** If manager approves, request is routed to the data/system owner for final approval.
4.  **Provisioning:**  
    *   Upon final approval, the responsible IT team (e.g., Sys Admin, Application Admin) grants the requested access.
5.  **Notification:**
