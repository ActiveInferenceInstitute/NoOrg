**Last Reviewed:** [Date]

## 1. Purpose

To define the detailed workflow for effectively identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security incidents, in support of the Incident Response Policy.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all suspected or confirmed information security incidents involving organizational IT assets.

## 3. Prerequisites

*   Designated Incident Response Team (IRT) members and contact information.
*   Access to forensic and monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM, endpoint detection).
*   Incident Response playbooks and communication plan.

## 4. Procedure Steps

1.  **Preparation:**  
    *   Ensure tools, documentation, and team roles are up-to-date.  
2.  **Detection & Identification:**  
    *   Monitor alerts, logs, and reports for anomalies.  
    *   Validate potential incident and classify severity.  
3.  **Containment:**  
    *   Short-Term: Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.  
    *   Long-Term: Apply temporary fixes (e.g., access controls, firewall rules).  
4.  **Eradication:**  
    *   Remove malware, close vulnerabilities, and harden systems.  
5.  **Recovery:**  
    *   Restore systems from clean backups, verify integrity, and resume normal operations.  
6.  **Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned):**  
    *   Conduct a review meeting, document root cause, and update policies and procedures.  

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **IRT Lead:** Coordinates response and communication.  
*   **Forensic Analyst:** Gathers and analyzes evidence.
