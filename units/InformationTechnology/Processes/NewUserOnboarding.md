## 4. Procedure Steps

1.  **Request Logging:**

2.  **Account Provisioning:**  
    *   Create Active Directory (AD) user account.
    *   Provision corporate email mailbox.
    *   Create or assign application-specific user accounts (e.g., CRM, ERP).
3.  **Hardware Provisioning:**  
    *   Order or assign hardware (laptop, desktop, accessories).
    *   Configure hardware with standard OS image, apply security baseline and antivirus software.
4.  **Access and Permissions:**  
    *   Assign role-based access to network shares, file systems, and applications.
    *   Enable VPN or remote access if required.

    *   Install department-specific or specialized software as requested.
6.  **Documentation:**  
    *   Record asset tags, serial numbers, and assigned user in the IT Asset Management system.
    *   Document all created accounts and permissions in the ticket.
7.  **Orientation and Handover:**  
    *   Notify the hiring manager that provisioning is complete.
    *   Provide user with credentials, orientation guide, and contact information for support.
8.  **Post-Onboarding Review:**  
    *   After one week, verify that the user has all required access and that no outstanding tickets remain.
