**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** [Date]  
**Last Reviewed:** [Date]

## 1. Purpose

To define the process for performing regular data backups, verifying backup integrity, and restoring data to maintain business continuity and compliance.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all critical data repositories, including file servers, databases, application data, and cloud storage used by the organization.

## 3. Prerequisites

*   Inventory of data sources and backup schedules.
*   Backup storage systems and offsite replication configured.
*   Access to backup and recovery tools (e.g., Veeam, Bacula, SAN snapshots).

## 4. Procedure Steps

1.  **Backup Scheduling:**  
    *   Define backup frequency (e.g., daily full, hourly incremental) based on Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
    *   Configure backup jobs in the backup system.
2.  **Execution:**  
    *   Automated backup jobs run according to schedule.
    *   Monitoring and logging of backup job status.
3.  **Verification & Testing:**  
    *   Perform regular backup verifications (e.g., checksum validation, test restores).
    *   Document verification results and address failures proactively.
4.  **Retention Management:**  
    *   Automatically manage retention policies (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly snapshots).
    *   Ensure compliance with data retention regulations.
5.  **Offsite/Cloud Replication:**  
    *   Replicate backups to an offsite location or cloud storage for disaster recovery.
6.  **Restoration:**  
    *   Initiate data restore requests via ITSM ticket.
    *   Retrieve appropriate backup copy based on RPO/RTO requirements.
    *   Restore data to the target system or sandbox environment.
    *   Validate data integrity and completeness after restore.
7.  **Documentation & Closure:**  
    *   Record backup and restore activities in the backup log and ITSM ticket.
    *   Close restore requests once verified successful.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Backup Administrator:** Configures backup schedules, monitors jobs, and manages retention policies.  
*   **Systems Administrator:** Performs restoration tests and validates data integrity.  
*   **IT Manager:** Reviews backup reports and approves changes to schedules.
