The goal is to ensure that executive communications are consistent, clear, accurate, timely, and aligned with the organization's strategy, values, and brand.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all official communications by members of the Executive Unit, including but not limited to:
*   Internal communications (e.g., company-wide announcements, strategy updates, policy changes)
*   External communications (e.g., press releases, investor relations, public speeches, social media engagement, regulatory filings)
*   Crisis communications

## 3. Principles

*   **Transparency:** Be open and honest in communications, while respecting confidentiality requirements.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all information communicated is factual and verified.

*   **Timeliness:** Communicate important information promptly to relevant stakeholders.
*   **Clarity:** Use clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience.
*   **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional tone and demeanor in all communications.
*   **Alignment:** Ensure communications reflect the organization's strategic goals, values, and brand identity.
*   **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive and non-public information.

## 4. Internal Communications

*   **Strategic Updates:** The Executive Unit is responsible for communicating the organization's strategy, performance, and significant changes to employees.
*   **Major Announcements:** Significant internal announcements (e.g., reorganizations, policy changes) should be coordinated and approved within the Executive Unit, often in partnership with HR and internal communications teams.
*   **Channel Selection:** Use appropriate internal channels (e.g., town halls, emails, intranet) based on the message and audience.

## 5. External Communications

*   **Authorized Spokespersons:** Only designated individuals are authorized to speak on behalf of the organization to the media, investors, or the public. Typically, this includes the CEO and potentially other specific executives or the communications department.
*   **Coordination:** All significant external communications (press releases, official statements, investor presentations, regulatory filings) must be reviewed and approved by the relevant Executive(s), Legal, and Communications departments prior to release.
*   **Media Relations:** All media inquiries should be directed to the Communications department.
*   **Investor Relations:** Communications with investors and analysts must comply with applicable securities laws and regulations (e.g., Regulation Fair Disclosure) and be coordinated through the designated Investor Relations function or CFO.
*   **Social Media:** Executives using social media in a professional capacity must adhere to the organization's social media guidelines, maintain professionalism, and avoid disclosing confidential information.
*   **Public Appearances:** Speeches, presentations, or publications by executives representing the organization require appropriate internal review and approval.

## 6. Crisis Communications

During a crisis, all communications will be managed according to the [Crisis Management Process](../Processes/CrisisManagementProcess.md) and coordinated through the designated Crisis Management Team and Communications Lead to ensure accurate, consistent, and timely information flow.

## 7. Compliance and Enforcement

Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Violations may lead to disciplinary action. Misrepresenting the organization or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can have serious consequences.

## 8. Review

This policy will be reviewed periodically (e.g., annually) by the Executive Unit, Legal, and Communications departments.
