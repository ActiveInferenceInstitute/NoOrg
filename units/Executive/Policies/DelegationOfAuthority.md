# Executive Delegation of Authority Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for the delegation of authority from the Board of Directors to the CEO, and from the CEO to other members of the Executive Unit and, subsequently, throughout the organization. The purpose is to empower individuals to act and make decisions effectively within their defined scope, ensure accountability, and facilitate efficient operations while maintaining appropriate controls.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all levels of management and employees who are granted authority to make decisions or commitments on behalf of the organization.

## 3. Principles

*   **Clarity:** Delegations of authority must be clear, specific, and documented.
*   **Accountability:** Individuals delegated authority are accountable for the decisions and actions taken within that authority. Delegation of authority does not relieve the delegator of overall responsibility.
*   **Competence:** Authority should be delegated to individuals with the necessary skills, experience, and knowledge.
*   **Controls:** Delegation must be consistent with internal controls, segregation of duties, and risk management practices.
*   **Revocability:** Delegated authority can be modified or revoked by the delegating party.
*   **Sub-delegation:** Any sub-delegation of authority must be explicitly permitted by the original delegation and adhere to the same principles.

## 4. Delegation Framework

1.  **Board to CEO:** The Board of Directors delegates broad authority to the CEO to manage the day-to-day affairs of the organization, subject to specific limitations outlined in the Board Charter, Bylaws, and resolutions (e.g., thresholds for major transactions, strategic decisions requiring Board approval).
2.  **CEO to Executives:** The CEO delegates specific operational, financial, and decision-making authority to members of the Executive Unit based on their functional roles and responsibilities. These delegations are typically documented through position descriptions, formal memos, or a Delegation of Authority Matrix.
3.  **Executives Downward:** Executives may further delegate authority within their respective functions to subordinate managers and employees, consistent with the authority granted to them by the CEO and this policy.

## 5. Delegation of Authority (DoA) Matrix

A formal Delegation of Authority (DoA) Matrix is the primary tool for documenting specific authority limits. The DoA Matrix typically outlines:

*   **Decision/Action Type:** (e.g., Capital expenditure, contract approval, hiring, expense approval, policy approval).
*   **Authority Level:** The specific role or position authorized to approve the action.
*   **Financial Limits:** Monetary thresholds associated with the delegated authority.
*   **Required Approvals:** Any co-approval or notification requirements.
*   **Policy References:** Links to relevant supporting policies or procedures.

The Finance department and/or General Counsel typically maintain the official DoA Matrix, ensuring it is kept current and accessible.

## 6. Specific Areas of Delegation (Examples)

*   **Financial Authority:** Limits for approving expenditures (capital and operational), signing checks, entering into financial commitments.
*   **Contractual Authority:** Authority to negotiate and sign contracts on behalf of the organization, often tiered by contract value or type.
*   **Human Resources Authority:** Authority to hire, terminate, promote, and approve compensation actions.
*   **Policy Approval Authority:** Authority to approve functional or departmental policies and procedures.

## 7. Responsibilities

*   **Delegators:** Ensure delegations are clear, appropriate, communicated, and monitored.
*   **Delegates:** Understand the scope and limits of their delegated authority, exercise it responsibly, adhere to policies, and seek clarification when needed.
*   **Finance/Legal:** Maintain the DoA Matrix and provide guidance on its application.
*   **Internal Audit:** Periodically review adherence to the DoA framework as part of their audit plan.

## 8. Compliance and Enforcement

Exceeding delegated authority without proper approval is a serious violation and may result in disciplinary action. All actions taken under delegated authority must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies.

## 9. Review

This policy and the associated DoA Matrix will be reviewed periodically (e.g., annually or biannually) by the Executive Unit, Finance, Legal, and approved by the CEO and/or the Board's Audit or Governance Committee as appropriate.
