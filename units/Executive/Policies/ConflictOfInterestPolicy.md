# Executive Conflict of Interest Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for identifying, disclosing, and managing actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest involving members of the Executive Unit. The objective is to ensure that executive decisions are made solely in the best interests of the organization, free from undue personal influence.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all members of the Executive Unit and extends to their immediate family members (e.g., spouse, domestic partner, children, parents, siblings) where relevant.

## 3. Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest exists when an Executive's private interests interfere, or appear to interfere, in any way with the interests of the organization. This includes situations where an Executive or their immediate family member:

*   Has a significant financial interest (e.g., ownership, investment, compensation arrangement) in a company that does business with, seeks to do business with, or competes with the organization.
*   Holds a position (e.g., director, officer, employee, consultant) with a company that has a relationship with or competes with the organization.
*   Receives improper personal benefits (loans, services, gifts beyond nominal value) as a result of their position in the organization.
*   Has a personal, business, or family relationship that could influence their objectivity in making decisions on behalf of the organization.
*   Uses company property, information, or position for personal gain.
*   Takes advantage of a corporate opportunity that belongs to the organization.

## 4. Disclosure Requirements

Executives have an ongoing obligation to:

*   **Proactively Identify:** Be alert to potential conflicts of interest in their activities and relationships.
*   **Promptly Disclose:** Immediately disclose any actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interest in writing to the General Counsel (or designated ethics officer) and the CEO.
*   **Annual Disclosure:** Complete an annual disclosure statement certifying compliance with this policy and disclosing any ongoing potential conflicts.
*   **Update Disclosures:** Update disclosures promptly if circumstances change.

## 5. Management and Resolution

Upon disclosure of a conflict, the General Counsel and CEO (in consultation with the Board's Governance or Audit Committee, as appropriate) will review the situation and determine the appropriate course of action. Management strategies may include, but are not limited to:

*   **Recusal:** Requiring the Executive to recuse themselves from participating in discussions and decisions related to the matter.
*   **Divestiture:** Requiring the Executive to divest the conflicting interest.
*   **Resignation:** Requiring the Executive to resign from the conflicting external position.
*   **Monitoring:** Establishing procedures to monitor the situation.
*   **Waiver:** In rare circumstances where a conflict is deemed unavoidable but manageable and in the organization's best interest, a waiver may be granted by the Board or designated committee, with appropriate controls and disclosure.

All determinations and management plans will be documented.

## 6. Confidentiality

Disclosures made under this policy will be handled with appropriate confidentiality, shared only as necessary to assess and manage the conflict.

## 7. Compliance and Enforcement

Failure to disclose a conflict of interest or comply with the management plan determined under this policy is a serious violation and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, consistent with the [Executive Code of Conduct](./CodeOfConduct.md).

## 8. Review

This policy will be reviewed periodically (e.g., annually) by the General Counsel and the Board's Governance or Audit Committee.
