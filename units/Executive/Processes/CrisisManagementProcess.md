# Executive Crisis Management Process

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the process the Executive Unit follows to manage significant crises or emergencies that could impact the organization's operations, reputation, finances, or stakeholders. The objective is to ensure a swift, coordinated, and effective response to mitigate harm and facilitate recovery.

## 2. Scope

This process applies to major unforeseen events requiring immediate executive attention and coordinated action across multiple functions. Examples include: major operational failures, cybersecurity breaches, natural disasters affecting facilities, public relations crises, regulatory investigations, etc.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Executive Unit:** Provides overall leadership and strategic direction during a crisis. Makes critical decisions.
*   **CEO:** Leads the crisis response effort, acts as the primary decision-maker, and often the key spokesperson (or designates one).
*   **Crisis Management Team (CMT):** A pre-designated or ad-hoc team (often including specific Executives and functional leads like Legal, Communications, IT, HR, Operations) responsible for executing the response plan.
*   **Communications Lead:** Manages internal and external communications.
*   **Legal Counsel:** Provides legal advice and guidance.
*   **Functional Leads (IT, HR, Operations, etc.):** Manage the crisis impact within their respective areas.

## 4. Crisis Management Phases & Steps

**Phase 1: Activation & Assessment**

1.  **Crisis Identification & Alert:** A potential crisis is identified and reported through established channels to the Executive Unit/CEO.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** Gather preliminary information about the nature, scope, and potential impact of the event.
3.  **Process Activation:** CEO or designated executive formally activates the Crisis Management Process and convenes the Crisis Management Team (CMT).
4.  **Situation Assessment:** CMT conducts a rapid, detailed assessment of the situation, impact, and immediate risks.

**Phase 2: Response & Containment**

5.  **Strategic Direction Setting:** Executive Unit/CEO defines the immediate strategic objectives for the response (e.g., ensure safety, contain damage, maintain critical operations, protect reputation).
6.  **Action Plan Development:** CMT develops an immediate action plan with specific tasks, owners, and timelines.
7.  **Resource Mobilization:** Identify and allocate necessary resources (personnel, financial, technical).
8.  **Containment Actions:** Implement steps to contain the crisis and prevent escalation.
9.  **Stakeholder Communication (Initial):** Develop and disseminate initial communications to employees, customers, regulators, media, and other key stakeholders as appropriate, managed by the Communications Lead.

**Phase 3: Management & Coordination**

10. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the situation, the effectiveness of the response, and stakeholder reactions.
11. **Regular CMT Huddles:** Conduct frequent meetings (virtual or in-person) to share updates, coordinate actions, and adapt the plan.
12. **Executive Briefings:** Provide regular updates to the full Executive Unit and the Board of Directors.
13. **Decision Making:** Address emerging issues and make necessary decisions promptly based on the [Decision Making Framework](./DecisionMakingFramework.md).
14. **Documentation:** Maintain a log of events, actions taken, and decisions made.

**Phase 4: Recovery & Post-Crisis**

15. **Resolution & Recovery:** Implement plans to restore normal operations and address long-term impacts.
16. **Stand-Down:** Formally deactivate the crisis response structure when the situation is stabilized.
17. **Post-Incident Review (PIR):** Conduct a thorough review of the crisis event and the effectiveness of the response.
18. **Lessons Learned:** Identify key learnings and recommendations for improvement.
19. **Update Plans:** Update crisis management plans, processes, and training based on the PIR findings.
