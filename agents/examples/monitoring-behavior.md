# Monitoring Behavior

## Overview

### Purpose & Context
- Behavior Type: System Monitoring Pattern
- Application Domain: Performance and Health Monitoring
- Trigger Conditions: Metric Collection, Alert Conditions, Analysis Events

### Behavioral Model
```yaml
behavior_model:
  type: "adaptive_monitoring"
  category: "system_observation"
  complexity: "high"
  adaptability: "dynamic"
```

## Implementation

### Core Components

    A[Metric Collection] --> B[Data Processing]
    B --> C[Analysis Engine]
    C --> D[Alert Evaluation]
    D --> E[Action Generation]
    E --> F[Response Execution]
    
    G[Historical Data] -.-> B
    G -.-> C
    H[Alert Rules] -.-> D
    I[Learning System] -.-> C
    I -.-> D
```

### State Machine
```yaml
states:
  collecting:
    transitions:
      - to: processing
        condition: data_received
  processing:
    actions:
      - validate_data
      - normalize_metrics
    transitions:
      - to: analyzing
        condition: data_valid
      - to: error
        condition: validation_failed
  analyzing:
    actions:
      - analyze_trends
      - detect_anomalies
    transitions:
      - to: alerting
        condition: threshold_exceeded
      - to: collecting
        condition: analysis_complete
  alerting:
    actions:
      - generate_alert
      - determine_severity
    transitions:
      - to: responding
        condition: action_required
      - to: collecting
        condition: notification_sent
  responding:
    actions:
      - execute_response
      - update_status
    transitions:
      - to: collecting
        condition: response_complete
      - to: error_handling
        condition: response_failed
  error_handling:
    actions:
      - log_error
      - attempt_recovery
    transitions:
      - to: collecting
        condition: recovery_successful
      - to: failed
        condition: recovery_failed
```

## Interaction Pattern

### Input Processing
```yaml
inputs:
  metrics:
    - type: system_metric
      data: time_series_format
    - type: agent_status
      data: health_check_format
  events:
    - type: threshold_breach
      priority: high
    - type: anomaly_detected
      priority: medium
```

### Output Generation
```yaml
outputs:
  alerts:
    - type: alert_notification
      effect: notify_operators
    - type: corrective_action
      effect: system_adjustment
  reports:
    - type: performance_report
      destination: monitoring_system
    - type: health_status
      destination: system_dashboard
```

## Learning & Adaptation

### Learning Mechanisms
```yaml
learning:
  method: online_learning
  parameters:
    - name: threshold_adjustment_rate
      value: 0.01
    - name: anomaly_sensitivity
      value: 0.05
  objectives:
    - optimize_alert_accuracy
    - reduce_false_positives
    - improve_prediction_accuracy
```

### Adaptation Rules
```yaml
adaptation:
  conditions:
    - trigger: false_positive_rate
      threshold: 5%
      action: adjust_sensitivity
    - trigger: missed_anomalies
      threshold: 1%
      action: increase_sensitivity
  constraints:
    - maintain_detection_rate
    - limit_alert_frequency
```

### Communication
```yaml
communication:
  internal:
    - target: metric_store
      protocol: [[protocols#metric-storage]]
    - target: alert_manager
      protocol: [[protocols#alert-handling]]
  external:
    - target: monitored_systems
      protocol: [[protocols#metric-collection]]
```

## Performance

### Metrics
```yaml
metrics:
  collection:
    - metric: collection_rate
      threshold: 10000_metrics_per_second
    - metric: processing_latency
      threshold: 50ms
  analysis:
    - metric: analysis_accuracy
      threshold: 0.99
    - metric: detection_latency
      threshold: 100ms
```

### Optimization
```yaml
optimization:
  strategies:
    - name: adaptive_sampling
      trigger: high_load
      action: adjust_sample_rate
    - name: batch_processing
