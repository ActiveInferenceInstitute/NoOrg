# Quality Assurance Documentation

This section outlines the processes, standards, and tools used for ensuring the quality, reliability, and correctness of the system, particularly focusing on AI agents and their outputs.

## Overview

*   [[quality/verification-methods|Verification Methods]]: Techniques for verifying agent outputs and system behavior.
*   [[quality/hallucination-detection|Hallucination Detection]]: Strategies for identifying and mitigating inaccurate or fabricated information from LLMs.
*   [[quality/regression-testing|Regression Testing]]: Procedures for ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality.
*   [[quality/continuous-evaluation|Continuous Evaluation]]: Framework for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of agent performance in production.
*   [[testing/test-strategies|Test Strategies]]: Overall approach to testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Key Areas

*   **Testing:** Methodologies and frameworks for automated and manual testing.
*   **Verification:** Processes for confirming outputs meet requirements and standards.
*   **Evaluation:** Metrics and procedures for assessing performance and accuracy.
*   **Monitoring:** Tools and techniques for observing system quality in real-time.
