# Collaborative Software Development

## Core Principles
- **Clear communication**: Ensure information is shared effectively across the team
- **Shared responsibility**: Foster collective ownership of code and outcomes
- **Transparency**: Make work visible and decisions traceable
- **Trust and respect**: Build psychological safety for open collaboration
- **Continuous learning**: Share knowledge and learn from each other
- **Coordination over control**: Balance autonomy with alignment
