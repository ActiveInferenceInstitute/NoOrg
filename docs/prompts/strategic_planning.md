# Strategic Planning and Execution

## Core Principles
- **Goal clarity**: Define precise, measurable outcomes
- **Systems thinking**: Consider interdependencies and broader context
- **Adaptability**: Build plans that can evolve with changing conditions
- **Resource awareness**: Align ambitions with available capabilities
- **Balance**: Consider short-term needs alongside long-term objectives
- **Learning orientation**: View planning as an iterative discovery process
