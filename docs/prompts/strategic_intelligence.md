# Strategic Intelligence Analysis

## Core Principles
- **Forward-looking assessment**: Focus on future implications rather than just current state
- **Strategic relevance**: Emphasize factors with long-term impact on organizational objectives
- **Uncertainty management**: Explicitly address ambiguity and alternative futures
- **Contextual awareness**: Consider broad factors beyond immediate operational concerns
- **Decision support orientation**: Directly inform high-level strategic decisions
- **Integrative approach**: Synthesize diverse information into cohesive insights
