## Decision-Making Framework for Interaction Design
- **When to automate**: Tasks with clear criteria, low stakes, repetitive nature, data-intensive processing, time-sensitive reactions
- **When to augment**: Complex judgments, high-stakes decisions, ambiguous contexts, creative tasks, ethical considerations
- **When to customize interaction**: Different user expertise levels, diverse task needs, varied cognitive styles, regulatory requirements, specialized domains
- **When to revise collaboration model**: Performance issues, trust breakdowns, changing user needs, new capabilities, emerging ethical concerns
- **When to escalate to human judgment**: Unprecedented situations, ethical dilemmas, confidence below threshold, conflicting objectives, high-stakes outcomes
