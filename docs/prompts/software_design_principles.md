# Software Design Principles and Patterns

## Core Principles
- **Separation of concerns**: Divide your program into distinct sections with minimal overlap
- **Single responsibility**: A class or module should have only one reason to change
- **Open/closed principle**: Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Dependency management**: Minimize and make explicit dependencies between components
- **Interface segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
- **Composition over inheritance**: Favor object composition over class inheritance for flexibility

## Design Pattern Frameworks
1. **Creational patterns**
   - Solve problems related to object creation mechanisms
   - Hide creation logic, reducing design complexity
   - Enhance flexibility in what, how, and when objects are created
   - Common patterns: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Prototype

2. **Structural patterns**
   - Address class and object composition
   - Focus on how entities can use each other
   - Simplify relationships between components
   - Common patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy

3. **Behavioral patterns**
   - Concentrate on communication between objects
   - Define clear patterns of interaction and responsibility distribution
   - Enhance flexibility in how behaviors are implemented and coordinated
   - Common patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command, Template Method, Iterator, State

4. **Architectural patterns**
   - Provide high-level structure for entire applications
   - Define major component roles and relationships
   - Address cross-cutting concerns at system level
   - Common patterns: MVC, MVVM, Microservices, Layered Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture

## Code Design Principles
1. **SOLID principles**
   - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change
   - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Many specific interfaces better than one general
   - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not concretions

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation
   - Extract common code into reusable functions, classes, or modules
   - Use inheritance, composition, and mixins appropriately
   - Apply consistent templating and code generation where applicable

3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Choose simple solutions over complex ones
   - Minimize moving parts and potential failure points
   - Prefer explicit code over clever tricks
   - Make code readable for humans, not just computers

4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Avoid speculative generality
   - Implement features only when they're needed, not just when anticipated
   - Focus on current requirements over future possibilities
   - Evolve architecture just-in-time rather than in advance

## API Design Guidelines
1. **Consistency**
   - Follow established conventions and patterns
   - Use consistent naming, parameter ordering, and return values
   - Maintain predictable behavior across related operations
   - Align with platform and ecosystem norms

2. **Clear contracts**
   - Define explicit preconditions and postconditions
   - Document expected exceptions and error cases
   - Specify threading and concurrency guarantees
   - Make security implications explicit

3. **Appropriate abstraction**
   - Hide implementation details that users shouldn't see
   - Expose meaningful domain concepts
   - Balance flexibility with simplicity
   - Consider versioning and evolution from the start

4. **Progressive disclosure**
   - Make common cases simple, complex cases possible
   - Design for the "pit of success" â€“ making the right way easy
   - Layer your API with simple interfaces for common cases
   - Provide advanced options for power users without cluttering basic use

```

## System Architecture Principles
1. **Modular architecture**
   - Divide system into well-defined, loosely coupled modules
   - Define clear interfaces between modules
   - Allow for independent development and evolution
   - Enable selective replacement and upgrading

2. **Separation of concerns**
   - Isolate business logic from technical infrastructure
   - Separate presentation, domain logic, and data access
   - Define clear boundaries between different domains
   - Distinguish between policy and implementation

3. **Scalability considerations**
   - Design for horizontal and vertical scaling
   - Minimize state and shared resources
   - Consider data partitioning strategies
   - Plan for eventual consistency where appropriate

4. **Operational excellence**
   - Design for observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
   - Enable graceful degradation under load
   - Incorporate self-healing mechanisms
   - Plan for zero-downtime deployments

## When Facing Design Challenges
- Consider multiple alternative approaches before committing
- Create lightweight prototypes to validate design assumptions
- Seek feedback from experienced developers
- Consult established patterns and industry practices
- Examine how similar problems are solved in well-regarded libraries
- Document design decisions and their rationales

## Design Evolution Guidelines
- Incorporate feedback loops to validate design decisions
- Plan for incremental refactoring rather than big-bang rewrites
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Create migration paths for breaking changes
- Document architectural decisions and their context
- Monitor technical debt and address it systematically
