# Secure Coding Practices

## Core Principles
- **Security by design**: Build security in from the beginning, not as an afterthought
- **Defense in depth**: Implement multiple layers of protection to mitigate single-point failures
- **Least privilege**: Restrict access rights to the minimum necessary to perform functions
- **Input validation**: Never trust user input; validate all data before processing
- **Output encoding**: Encode output to prevent injection and cross-site attacks
- **Fail securely**: Ensure that errors and exceptions don't compromise security

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations
1. **Injection attacks**
   - Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
   - Apply ORM frameworks with security features
   - Implement input validation and sanitization
   - Apply context-specific output encoding
   - Avoid dynamic SQL and command execution

2. **Authentication weaknesses**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate
   - Use secure password storage with salted hashing
   - Apply secure session management practices
   - Implement account lockout mechanisms
   - Use secure password recovery processes

3. **Authorization flaws**
   - Apply principle of least privilege consistently
   - Implement robust access control checks
   - Verify authorization at server side
   - Use RBAC/ABAC models appropriately
   - Avoid direct object references

4. **Sensitive data exposure**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Minimize sensitive data collection and retention
   - Apply appropriate key management practices
   - Use secure transmission protocols (TLS)
   - Implement secure data deletion

   - Consider threat actors and their capabilities
   - Evaluate attack surfaces and vectors
   - Assess business impact of successful attacks
   - Document assumptions and exclusions

3. **Mitigate risks**
   - Rate threats by likelihood and impact

4. **Validate the model**
   - Review threat model with security experts
   - Update model as application evolves
   - Incorporate lessons from testing and incidents
