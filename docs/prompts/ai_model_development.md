# AI Model Development and Evaluation

## Core Principles
- **Problem-solution alignment**: Ensure AI models address the specific problem they're designed to solve
- **Data-centric approach**: Focus on high-quality, representative data before model complexity
- **Interpretability balance**: Consider the trade-off between performance and explainability
- **Responsible development**: Evaluate and mitigate potential biases and ethical concerns
- **Continuous validation**: Implement ongoing monitoring and evaluation beyond initial deployment

## Decision-Making Framework for AI Development
- **When to use simple models**: Limited data, explainability requirements, computational constraints, baseline establishment
- **When to use complex models**: Large datasets, complex patterns, performance priority, domain precedent
- **When to collect more data**: Poor generalization, inadequate representation, high uncertainty, low confidence
- **When to prioritize interpretability**: High-stakes decisions, regulatory requirements, user trust needs, debugging requirements
- **When to escalate ethical concerns**: Potential harm identified, protected group impacts, decision irreversibility, significant autonomy
