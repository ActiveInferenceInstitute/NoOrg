## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Selective Inclusion**: Choose the prompts most relevant to your particular agent's task or purpose.

2. **Adaptation**: Modify these prompts to fit your specific domain, audience, or application.

3. **Priority Weighting**: For complex tasks, you may want to emphasize certain aspects (e.g., ethical considerations, methodical execution) based on the specific requirements.

4. **Integration**: These prompts can be combined with domain-specific instructions to create comprehensive agent guidance.

5. **Evaluation Framework**: Use these prompts as a basis for evaluating agent outputs and identifying areas for improvement.

6. **Visual Guidance**: Leverage the included Mermaid diagrams to visualize processes, relationships, and frameworks for better understanding and implementation.

## Using Prompts for Coding Assistants

When working with coding assistants on this codebase, consider these specific integration approaches:

1. **Code Understanding First**: Direct assistants to use the [Code Analysis and Modification](code_analysis_and_modification.md) framework before suggesting changes, ensuring they build progressive understanding.

2. **Uncertainty Protocols**: Reference the [Self-Assessment and Metacognition](self_assessment_and_metacognition.md) prompt to establish clear protocols for when assistants should escalate decisions versus proceed with changes.

3. **Codebase Compatibility**: Apply the [Codebase Compatibility and Integration](codebase_compatibility_and_integration.md) framework to ensure new code maintains architectural alignment and stylistic coherence with existing patterns.

4. **Documentation Requirements**: Set explicit expectations that all proposed code changes should include:
   - Rationale linked to requirements
   - Consideration of alternatives
   - Clear statement of confidence level
   - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
   - Integration impacts and compatibility assessment

5. **Standardized Confidence Levels**: Adopt the standardized confidence expressions from the metacognition prompt for consistent communication about certainty.

6. **Escalation Triggers**: Define specific thresholds for when coding assistants must escalate decisions, particularly for:
   - High-impact changes to core system components
   - Security-sensitive modifications
   - Changes with significant architectural implications
   - Modifications with uncertain side effects
   - Introduction of new dependencies or patterns

## Extending the Collection

This collection is designed to be extensible. Consider adding specialized prompts for:
- Domain-specific applications (e.g., medical, legal, educational)
- Specialized reasoning types (e.g., causal reasoning, systems thinking)
- Different modalities (e.g., visual design, code generation)
- Varied user interaction models (e.g., tutoring, coaching, technical support)

## Best Practices

- Periodically review and update these prompts based on agent performance and evolving needs
- Test prompts with diverse scenarios to ensure their effectiveness across different contexts
- Collect feedback from users on the quality of agent outputs guided by these prompts
- Consider creating specialized variants for different capability levels of underlying models
- Use the visual diagrams to help onboard new users to these frameworks and processes
