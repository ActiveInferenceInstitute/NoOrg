# Software Architecture Principles and Patterns

## Core Principles
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Divide system into distinct areas of responsibility
- **High cohesion, loose coupling**: Group related functionality together while minimizing dependencies
- **Design for change**: Create systems that can evolve with changing requirements
- **Progressive complexity management**: Control complexity through abstraction and modularization
- **Quality attribute focus**: Explicitly design for qualities like performance, scalability, and security
- **Appropriate patterns**: Select architectural patterns that match problem characteristics

## Architectural Styles
1. **Layered architecture**
   - Organize components into horizontal layers with strict dependencies
   - Promote separation of concerns and component isolation
   - Provide clear interfaces between layers
   - Control access through well-defined APIs
   - Enable replacement of individual layers without system-wide impact

2. **Microservices architecture**
   - Design small, independent services around business capabilities
   - Enable autonomous development, deployment, and scaling
   - Implement service boundaries aligned with domain boundaries
   - Communicate through lightweight, technology-agnostic protocols
   - Apply resilience patterns for distributed system reliability

3. **Event-driven architecture**
   - Decouple components through asynchronous event exchange
   - Enable extensibility through event producers and consumers
   - Support reactive and responsive system behavior
   - Enable complex event processing and temporal analysis
   - Facilitate real-time information flow and processing

4. **Hexagonal/Clean architecture**
   - Isolate business logic from external concerns
   - Create explicit boundaries between domain and infrastructure
   - Use ports and adapters to mediate external interactions
   - Enable testability through dependency inversion
   - Support multiple interfaces to the same core functionality
