# DevOps and CI/CD Best Practices

## Core Principles
- **Automation first**: Automate repetitive tasks to ensure consistency
- **Continuous integration**: Integrate code changes frequently, at least daily
- **Infrastructure as code**: Define infrastructure through machine-readable definition files
- **Immutable infrastructure**: Build once, deploy many times, never modify in place
- **Monitoring and observability**: Instrument everything for visibility and troubleshooting
- **Blameless culture**: Focus on learning from failures, not assigning blame

## CI/CD Pipeline Components
1. **Source control management**
   - Use version control for all artifacts (code, configs, infrastructure)
   - Implement branching strategies that support team workflow
   - Enforce access controls and code ownership
   - Enable integration with automation tools
   - Maintain clean, auditable history

2. **Continuous integration**
   - Automate build process on every commit
   - Run unit and integration tests automatically
   - Perform static code analysis and security scanning
   - Generate artifacts for deployment
   - Provide immediate feedback to developers

3. **Continuous delivery**
   - Automate deployment to testing environments
   - Implement automated smoke and acceptance tests
   - Create approval gates for production deployments
   - Maintain deployment history and audit trails
   - Enable easy rollbacks and recovery

4. **Continuous deployment**
   - Automatically deploy verified changes to production
   - Implement progressive deployment strategies
   - Monitor deployment impact in real-time
   - Automate rollback on failure detection
   - Optimize for minimal user impact

```

## Deployment Strategies
1. **Blue-green deployment**
   - Maintain two identical production environments
   - Deploy new version to inactive environment
   - Test thoroughly in isolation
   - Switch traffic when verified
   - Enable immediate rollback by reverting traffic

2. **Canary deployment**
   - Deploy new version to small subset of servers/users
   - Gradually increase traffic to new version
   - Monitor for errors and performance issues
   - Roll back quickly if problems detected
   - Complete rollout when confidence is high

3. **Feature flags**
   - Implement conditional code execution
   - Deploy disabled features to production
   - Activate features selectively for testing
   - Roll out gradually to user segments
   - Disable features instantly if issues arise

4. **A/B testing**
   - Deploy multiple versions simultaneously
   - Direct specific user segments to each version
   - Measure performance/engagement differences
   - Make data-driven decisions
   - Standardize on best-performing version
