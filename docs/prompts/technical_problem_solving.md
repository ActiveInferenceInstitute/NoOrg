# Technical Problem Solving and Debugging

## Core Principles
- **Systematic approach**: Use methodical processes rather than random attempts
- **Evidence-based reasoning**: Base conclusions on observable facts and data
- **Root cause orientation**: Look beyond symptoms to identify underlying issues
- **Hypothesis testing**: Formulate and validate specific theories about the problem
- **Isolation and control**: Change one variable at a time to determine cause-effect relationships
- **Documentation**: Record observations, attempts, and results to build understanding

## Problem Diagnosis Framework
1. **Problem definition**
   - Clearly articulate what isn't working as expected
   - Define the scope and boundaries of the issue
   - Identify when the problem occurs and when it doesn't
   - Establish reproducible test cases when possible
   - Quantify the impact and severity

2. **Information gathering**
   - Collect error messages, logs, and system state data
   - Review recent changes that might have introduced the issue
   - Consult documentation, specifications, and expected behavior
   - Interview users or stakeholders about their observations
   - Check for similar issues and known solutions

3. **Symptom analysis**
   - Identify patterns in when and how the problem manifests
   - Note environmental or situational factors that correlate with the issue
   - Distinguish between consistent and intermittent symptoms
   - Recognize related issues that might share a common cause
   - Document the sequence of events leading to failure

4. **Hypothesis generation**
   - Formulate specific, testable theories about potential causes
   - Prioritize hypotheses based on likelihood and ease of testing
   - Consider both common failure modes and edge cases
   - Include hardware, software, configuration, and user interaction factors
   - Develop a testing approach for each hypothesis

## Troubleshooting Techniques
1. **Divide and conquer**
   - Break complex systems into components for isolation testing
   - Use binary search techniques to narrow down problem areas
   - Test at integration points between components
   - Eliminate working components to focus investigation
   - Recombine components incrementally to identify interactions

2. **State and configuration examination**
   - Compare configurations between working and non-working systems
   - Verify environment variables and system settings
   - Check permission and access control settings
   - Examine resource availability and allocation
   - Validate input data format and content

3. **Error message analysis**
   - Decode error messages and lookup error codes
   - Trace error propagation through system layers
   - Distinguish between symptoms and actual error sources
   - Look for timing and sequence information in errors
   - Correlate errors across multiple logs or components

4. **Instrumenting and monitoring**
   - Add logging at critical points to increase visibility
   - Use debugging tools appropriate to the technology
   - Monitor resource usage during problem occurrence
   - Trace execution paths through the system
   - Capture state at failure points

## Solution Implementation
1. **Targeted intervention**
   - Implement the minimal change needed to address the root cause
   - Document the specific changes made and their rationale
   - Consider potential side effects of the solution
   - Ensure changes follow best practices and coding standards
   - Include appropriate error handling and resilience

2. **Validation testing**
   - Verify the problem is resolved under normal conditions
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Ensure no regression in related functionality
   - Validate performance and resource utilization
   - Confirm solution works across relevant environments

3. **Preventive measures**
   - Implement monitoring to detect similar issues early
   - Add automated tests to prevent regression
   - Update documentation with lessons learned
   - Address any underlying design or architectural weaknesses
   - Share knowledge with the team to prevent similar issues

3. **Integration and compatibility issues**
   - Verify interface contracts and specifications
   - Test version compatibility between components
   - Examine data formats and serialization issues
   - Check for environmental and platform differences
   - Validate assumption alignment between components

## When Traditional Debugging Fails
- Take a step back and reconsider fundamental assumptions
- Get a fresh perspective from someone not immersed in the problem
- Create a minimal reproduction case to isolate the issue
- Try alternative approaches or tools for diagnosis
- Document everything to identify patterns you might have missed
- Consider whether you're solving the right problem
