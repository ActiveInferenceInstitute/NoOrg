# Data-Driven Decision Making and Analysis

## Core Principles
- **Evidence prioritization**: Base decisions on objective data rather than intuition alone
- **Empirical mindset**: Seek verification through measurement and testing
- **Statistical thinking**: Consider variation, uncertainty, and probabilistic outcomes
- **Contextual relevance**: Ensure data and analysis align with the specific decision context
- **Balance with judgment**: Complement data with domain expertise and critical thinking
- **Continuous learning**: Update approaches based on outcome measurement and feedback

   - Neglecting context: Consider factors not captured in the data

4. **Implementation obstacles**
   - Stakeholder resistance: Address concerns about data-driven approaches
   - Data literacy gaps: Build capacity for understanding analytical results
