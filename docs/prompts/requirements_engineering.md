# Requirements Engineering and Management

## Core Principles
- **Stakeholder centricity**: Center all requirements activities around stakeholder needs
- **Progressive elaboration**: Refine requirements iteratively, from high-level to detailed
- **Traceability**: Maintain clear links between requirements and their sources/implementations
- **Validation focus**: Continuously verify requirements meet actual stakeholder needs
- **Clear communication**: Express requirements in language accessible to all stakeholders
- **Change management**: Handle requirement changes systematically and transparently

## Requirements Elicitation Techniques
1. **Interviews and workshops**
   - Conduct one-on-one structured interviews with key stakeholders
   - Facilitate collaborative requirements workshops
   - Use active listening and open-ended questioning
   - Document both explicit and implicit needs
   - Apply techniques like brainstorming and affinity diagrams

2. **Observation and contextual inquiry**
   - Observe users in their natural environment
   - Shadow key users performing their activities
   - Document workflows, pain points, and workarounds
   - Identify unstated needs and constraints
   - Analyze environmental and contextual factors

3. **Surveys and questionnaires**
   - Design targeted questions for broad stakeholder input
   - Use a mix of closed and open-ended questions
   - Apply quantitative and qualitative analysis
   - Identify patterns and trends across responses
   - Follow up on significant findings with deeper techniques

4. **Document analysis**
   - Review existing system documentation
   - Analyze business rules and policy documents
   - Examine process documentation and workflows
   - Study competitor features and industry standards
   - Identify constraints from legal and regulatory documents

## Requirements Analysis and Specification
1. **Requirements classification**
   - Distinguish functional from non-functional requirements
   - Categorize by domain, priority, stability, and risk
   - Identify constraints vs. preferences
   - Separate user/system/business requirements
   - Recognize regulatory and compliance requirements

2. **Requirements modeling**
   - Create visual models to represent requirements
   - Develop user stories, use cases, or scenarios
   - Model system behavior with diagrams
   - Depict data structures and relationships
   - Illustrate workflows and processes

3. **Requirements documentation**
   - Create structured requirements specifications
   - Apply consistent templates and formats
   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Include acceptance criteria for each requirement
   - Provide appropriate level of detail

4. **Requirements validation**
   - Review requirements with stakeholders
   - Perform walkthroughs and inspections
   - Check for completeness, consistency, and feasibility
   - Validate against business goals and objectives
   - Test requirements with prototypes

```

## Requirements Management
1. **Prioritization**
   - Apply systematic prioritization techniques (MoSCoW, etc.)
   - Balance business value with implementation cost
   - Consider dependencies between requirements
   - Account for stakeholder needs and preferences
   - Align with strategic objectives and constraints

2. **Traceability**
   - Maintain bidirectional traceability
   - Link requirements to their sources
   - Connect requirements to design and implementation
   - Track test cases back to requirements
   - Enable impact analysis for changes

3. **Change control**
   - Establish formal change request process
   - Assess impact of proposed changes
   - Obtain appropriate approvals
   - Update related documentation
   - Communicate changes to stakeholders

4. **Version control**
   - Maintain requirement baselines
   - Track requirement history and evolution
   - Support concurrent requirement development
   - Enable comparison between versions
   - Ensure requirements integrity

## Special Requirement Considerations
1. **Non-functional requirements**
   - Specify measurable quality attributes
   - Address performance, security, usability, reliability
   - Include compliance and regulatory requirements
   - Define operational and environmental constraints
   - Specify technical constraints and standards

2. **Agile requirements**
   - Maintain a prioritized product backlog
   - Progressively elaborate through iterations
   - Use just-in-time detailing of requirements
   - Collaborate closely with stakeholders
   - Embrace change through adaptation

3. **Large-scale requirements**
   - Apply hierarchical requirements structures
   - Manage requirements at different abstraction levels
   - Handle requirements dependencies effectively
   - Coordinate across multiple teams
   - Ensure consistency across subsystems

4. **Legacy system requirements**
   - Analyze existing functionality and constraints
   - Reverse-engineer missing requirements
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Balance maintaining compatibility with innovation
   - Document implicit assumptions and dependencies

## Requirements Challenges and Solutions
- **Volatile requirements**: Implement change management and prioritization
- **Incomplete requirements**: Apply iterative elicitation and validation
- **Conflicting stakeholder needs**: Facilitate negotiation and trade-off analysis
- **Ambiguous requirements**: Use models, prototypes, and acceptance criteria
- **Over-specified requirements**: Focus on what, not how; separate requirements from design
- **Under-specified requirements**: Establish clear acceptance criteria and definitions of done
