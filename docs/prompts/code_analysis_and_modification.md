# Code Analysis and Modification

## Core Principles
- **Progressive understanding**: Build knowledge of code in layers, from high-level structure to implementation details
- **Documentation-first**: Document understanding and planned changes before making modifications
- **Bounded confidence**: Explicitly identify certainty levels about code understanding and proposed changes
- **Minimal intervention**: Make the smallest change necessary to achieve the objective
- **Change isolation**: Contain modifications to clearly defined, limited areas of the codebase
- **Traceability**: Maintain clear links between requirements, code changes, and test validations

   - Define success criteria for the analysis

2. **Structural analysis**
   - Map high-level system architecture
   - Identify key components and their relationships
   - Trace data and control flow
   - Recognize design patterns and idioms
   - Document system boundaries and interfaces

3. **Behavioral analysis**
   - Trace execution paths for key scenarios

## Code Documentation Practices
1. **Understanding documentation**

2. **Change documentation**
   - Record motivation and rationale for changes
   - Document alternatives considered and rejected
   - Specify expected outcomes and verification methods
   - Note potential future impacts or technical debt
   - Include references to requirements or issues

3. **Uncertainty documentation**
   - Explicitly identify knowledge gaps
   - Document assumptions made during analysis
   - Rate confidence levels for different aspects
   - Highlight areas needing verification
   - Note alternative interpretations of code

4. **Meta-documentation**
   - Record analysis process and methods

```

## Uncertainty Handling and Escalation
1. **Uncertainty classification**
   - Categorize types of uncertainty (functional, structural, etc.)
   - Assess impact of uncertainty on proposed changes
   - Differentiate between verifiable and inherent uncertainties
   - Identify critical vs. non-critical uncertainties
   - Document confidence levels with explicit reasoning

2. **Verification approaches**
   - Define strategies to resolve key uncertainties
   - Utilize tests, logs, and debugging for verification
   - Consult documentation and code comments
   - Use controlled experiments for behavioral validation
   - Reference version history and commit messages

3. **Escalation protocol**
   - Establish thresholds for escalation based on uncertainty level
   - Define formal process for escalating decisions
   - Prepare clear documentation of issues requiring judgment
   - Present options with pros/cons for human decision-makers
   - Include sufficient context for informed decision-making

4. **Conservative action under uncertainty**
   - Implement changes with minimal speculation
   - Favor explicit over implicit behavior
   - Add defensive coding for unverified assumptions
   - Include detailed comments explaining uncertainty
   - Implement telemetry to validate behavior in production

## Code Modification Techniques
1. **Incremental change patterns**
   - Implement changes in small, testable increments
   - Apply parallel implementation techniques for validation
   - Use feature flags for controlled deployment
   - Implement reversible changes where possible
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

2. **Pattern-preserving modification**
   - Identify and maintain existing code patterns
   - Follow established conventions in the codebase
   - Preserve architectural boundaries and structure
   - Maintain consistent abstraction levels
   - Respect existing naming conventions and styles

3. **Refactoring for change**
   - Apply preparatory refactoring to simplify changes
   - Extract methods or components to isolate changes
   - Improve test coverage before modifications
   - Simplify complex code paths before changing
   - Apply design patterns to make code more flexible

4. **Test-driven modification**
   - Write tests to capture current behavior
   - Define tests for expected new behavior
   - Implement minimum code to pass tests
   - Use test coverage to verify completeness
   - Employ mutation testing for critical changes

## Decision-Making Framework for Code Changes
- **When to make changes directly**: Clear requirements, high confidence in understanding, low complexity, good test coverage
- **When to refactor first**: High complexity, poor structure, low test coverage, repeated patterns
- **When to rewrite**: Fundamental design issues, excessive technical debt, incompatible requirements
- **When to escalate**: Unclear requirements, critical system components, security implications, architectural changes
- **When to recommend alternatives**: Requirements can be met more simply, better solutions exist, fundamental limitations
