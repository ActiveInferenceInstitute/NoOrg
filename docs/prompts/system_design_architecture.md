# System Design and Architecture

## Core Principles
- **Separation of concerns**: Divide systems into distinct components with well-defined responsibilities
- **Modularity**: Create independent, interchangeable modules that support system evolution
- **Scalability by design**: Architect systems to handle growth in users, data, and functionality
- **Resilience engineering**: Design for failure with graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
- **Appropriate abstraction**: Create the right abstractions at the right levels to manage complexity

## Architecture Design Process
1. **Requirements analysis**

   - Prioritize conflicting requirements
   - Document assumptions and risks

2. **Architecture exploration**
   - Consider multiple architectural styles
   - Evaluate technology options and constraints
   - Identify key architectural decisions
   - Create proof-of-concepts for critical components
   - Assess trade-offs between quality attributes

3. **Architecture definition**
   - Define component structure and relationships
   - Establish communication patterns and protocols
   - Document data models and flows
   - Specify interfaces and contracts
   - Create deployment and infrastructure models

4. **Architecture validation**
   - Review against requirements and constraints
   - Conduct performance and scalability analysis
   - Perform security threat modeling
   - Test critical paths and integration points
   - Validate architecture with stakeholders

## Decision-Making Framework for Architecture
- **When to choose microservices**: Independent scaling needs, team autonomy focus, diverse technology requirements, complex domain with clear boundaries
- **When to prefer monolithic design**: Fast development priority, limited operational resources, simpler domain model, early-stage product with evolving boundaries
- **When to apply event-driven patterns**: Loose coupling priority, complex workflows, audit requirements, asynchronous processing needs, integration with multiple systems
- **When to design for high availability**: Critical business functions, 24/7 operations, contractual uptime requirements, significant revenue impact from downtime
- **When to prioritize performance**: User experience directly affected, high-volume data processing, competitive advantage through speed, resource-intensive operations
