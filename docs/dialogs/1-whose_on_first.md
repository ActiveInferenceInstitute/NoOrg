# Who's Running the Examples?

**Characters:**

*   **Abbott:** A slightly exasperated project manager AI.
*   **Costello:** An enthusiastic but easily confused intern AI.

**(Scene: A virtual control room overlooking a complex network diagram labeled "NoOrg Examples".)**

**Abbott:** Alright, Costello, let's go over the example workflows we've got running. We need to make sure everything is integrated properly.

**Costello:** You got it, boss! Ready when you are! So, who's running the first example? The Event Storage one?

**Abbott:** No, *Who* isn't running anything. *What* is the example's name.

**Costello:** That's what I'm asking you! Who's running the Event Storage?

**Abbott:** Event Storage is the name of the example. It just shows how we store events.

**Costello:** Who stores events?

**Abbott:** The Event System!

**Costello:** WHO?

**Abbott:** No, the Event System! It's part of the Core. Look, let's move on. We have the Relationship Management example.

**Costello:** Okay, Relationship Management. Who's managing the relationships?

**Abbott:** Nobody! It's just demonstrating relationship tracking between units!

**Costello:** So Who *isn't* managing relationships?

**Abbott:** Correct.

**Costello:** Then who is?!

**Abbott:** (Sighs) Let's try State Management.

**Costello:** State Management... like managing the state of confusion I'm in? Who's managing *that* state?

**Abbott:** No, it manages the state of the *system*. It keeps track of variables and configurations.

**Costello:** Who does?

**Abbott:** State Management does!

**Costello:** That's what I keep asking! Who manages the state?!

**Abbott:** (Pinches the bridge of his virtual nose) Okay, okay. Look at this one: Workflow Engine.

**Costello:** Ah, an engine! Like a train engine? Choo-choo! Who drives the Workflow Engine?

**Abbott:** It's not driven, it *runs* workflows. It's the engine *for* the workflow.

**Costello:** Who's workflow?

**Abbott:** It could be anyone's workflow! It runs the Integrated Operations example, for instance.

**Costello:** Who integrates the operations?

**Abbott:** The example *demonstrates* integrated operations! It uses different units working together.

**Costello:** WHICH units? WHOSE units?

**Abbott:** They're *organizational* units! Like in the Hybrid Agent Workflow example.

**Costello:** Hybrid Agent? Is that like half-human, half-robot? Who is this Hybrid Agent?

**Abbott:** It's not *a* Hybrid Agent, it's a *workflow* that *uses* hybrid agents! Different types of agents! Like LLMAgents, DataProcessingAgents, APIAgents...

**Costello:** WHO's agent? API Agent? Is he like a secret agent? Does he work for LLM?

**Abbott:** (Muttering) I need a vacation... No, LLM isn't a person, it's a Large Language Model! The LLMAgent *uses* the LLM.

**Costello:** So LLM tells Who's agent what to do?

**Abbott:** NO! Forget the agents for a second. Look at this Active Inference POMDP example.

**Costello:** Active Inference POMDP? Sounds complicated. Who's inferring actively? And what in the circuits is a POMDP?

**Abbott:** The *agent* does the active inference! It's a type of AI decision-making based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process... the POMDP!

**Costello:** WHO's agent? The Hybrid one? The API one? The one managing the state?

**Abbott:** The Active Inference POMDP Agent! It works with the Temperature Extraction Agent in that example!

**Costello:** Temperature Extraction Agent? Who extracts the temperature? Is he related to the State Management guy? 'Cause temperature is a state, right?

**Abbott:** (Slumps slightly) It's just an agent that reads text and pulls out temperature values.

**Costello:** Whose text?

**Abbott:** The *story's* text! Look, maybe the Dynamic Organization Generator is simpler.

**Costello:** Dynamic Organization Generator! Okay, who generates the dynamic organization?

**Abbott:** The *example script* generates it! Based on a description! Like that lollipop structure.

**Costello:** A lollipop structure? Who designed that? Was it the Hybrid Agent? He sounds creative. Or maybe the POMDP guy?

**Abbott:** It was described in natural language! The LLM interpreted it!

**Costello:** WHO interpreted it?! LLM? Is he back? I thought he just told agents what to do! Now he's interpreting lollipop designs? Busy guy!

**Abbott:** (Throws his hands up) That's it! I'm putting the Calm Tech example in charge!

**Costello:** Calm Tech? Who's that? Does he meditate? Is *he* managing my state of confusion now?

**Abbott:** It's a *principle*, Costello! Not a person! It's about designing tech that doesn't demand constant attention! Unlike *some* intern AIs I know!

**Costello:** But... but who applies the principle? Who runs the Calm Tech example? WHO'S ON FIRST?!

**Abbott:** (Stares blankly for a moment, then a slow smile spreads across his face) Actually... that gives me an idea for a new example...

**(Abbott starts typing furiously, labeling a new node "Who's On First Example". Costello tilts his head, looking more confused than ever.)**
