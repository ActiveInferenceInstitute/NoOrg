# Physical Security Framework

## Overview
This framework establishes the structure, methodology, and standards for implementing and managing physical security across the organization. It aligns with the [[security_framework]] while providing domain-specific guidance for physical security operations.

## Framework Components

### Core Elements

#### 1. Physical Protection
- **Perimeter Security**: Protection of organizational boundaries
- **Building Security**: Protection of structural elements
- **Space Security**: Protection of internal areas
- **Asset Security**: Protection of physical assets

#### 2. Access Control
- **Personnel Access**: Managing human access to facilities
- **Vehicle Access**: Managing vehicle entry and movement
- **Visitor Management**: Controlling non-employee access
- **Access Credentialing**: Managing access credentials

#### 3. Security Operations
- **Guard Force Operations**: Management of security personnel
- **Patrol Activities**: Systematic security checks
- **Surveillance Operations**: Electronic and human monitoring
- **Response Capabilities**: Reaction to security events

#### 4. Emergency Management
- **Incident Response**: Handling security incidents
- **Crisis Management**: Managing significant security events
- **Emergency Procedures**: Standardized emergency actions
- **Continuity Operations**: Maintaining essential functions

## Implementation Structure

## Risk-Based Implementation

### Risk Assessment Process
1. **Asset Identification**
   - Critical facility identification
   - Key asset inventory
   - Personnel concentrations
   - Operational dependencies

2. **Threat Assessment**
   - Threat actor identification
   - Historical incident analysis
   - Intelligence integration
   - Vulnerability mapping

3. **Risk Evaluation**
   - Risk scoring methodology
   - Consequence analysis
   - Likelihood determination
   - Control effectiveness assessment

4. **Control Selection**
   - Risk-based control priorities
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Implementation planning
   - Resource allocation

## Security Zones Model

### Zone Classification
- **Public Zone**: Unrestricted access areas
- **Reception Zone**: Controlled entry points
- **Administrative Zone**: General employee areas
- **Secured Zone**: Protected operational areas
- **Critical Zone**: Highly restricted areas

### Zone Controls
- **Progressive Access Restrictions**: Increasing security with zone sensitivity
- **Layered Protection**: Multiple security measures in depth
- **Appropriate Technology**: Right-sized technical solutions
- **Measured Response**: Zone-appropriate security response

## Integration Points
