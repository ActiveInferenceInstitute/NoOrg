# Cognitive Security Framework

## Overview
This framework establishes the structure, methodology, and standards for addressing cognitive security threats across the organization. It integrates with the [[security_framework]] while providing specialized guidance for protecting against information manipulation, psychological vulnerabilities, and decision-making attacks.
