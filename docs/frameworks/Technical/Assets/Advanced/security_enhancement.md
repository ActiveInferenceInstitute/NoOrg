# Security Enhancement Program

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive security enhancement program, building upon existing [[security_architecture|security architecture]] and [[security_governance|governance framework]].

## Zero Trust Implementation
### Identity Verification
- Multi-factor authentication
- [[identity_management|Identity validation]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance verification]]
- Access certification

### Access Management
- Least privilege access
- [[security_operations|Access controls]]
- Permission management
- Session control

### Network Segmentation
- Micro-segmentation
- [[network_security|Security zones]]
- Traffic isolation
- Perimeter security

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring
- [[security_operations|Security analytics]]
- Behavior analysis
- Threat detection

## Security Automation
### Threat Detection
- Automated scanning
- [[threat_management|Threat intelligence]]
- Pattern recognition
- Alert generation

### Response Orchestration
- Automated response
- [[security_operations|Incident management]]
- Workflow automation
- Recovery procedures

### Recovery Automation
- System recovery
- [[data_security|Data recovery]]
- Service restoration
- State verification

### Compliance Checking
- Automated audits
- [[security_compliance|Compliance verification]]
- Policy validation
- Report generation

## Security Analytics Platform
### Risk Scoring
- Risk assessment
- [[threat_management|Threat scoring]]
- Vulnerability rating
- Impact analysis

### Threat Intelligence
- Intelligence gathering
- [[security_operations|Threat analysis]]
- Pattern detection
- Risk prediction

### Behavior Analysis
- User behavior
- System behavior
- [[security_operations|Anomaly detection]]
- Pattern recognition

### Performance Metrics
- Security metrics
- [[security_compliance|Compliance metrics]]
- Operational metrics
- Effectiveness measures

## Integration Points
- [[token_framework|Token Framework]]
- [[asset_classification|Asset Framework]]
- [[security_architecture|Security Architecture]]
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure Framework]]

## Security Considerations
- [[security_governance|Governance Requirements]]
- [[threat_management|Threat Mitigation]]
- [[data_security|Data Protection]]
- [[network_security|Network Security]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
- Regular security reviews
- Performance optimization
- Feature updates
- Compliance maintenance
