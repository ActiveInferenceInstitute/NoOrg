# Deployment Strategy

## üìã Overview
This document defines the strategic approaches, methodologies, and best practices for deploying applications and services across different environments, minimizing risk, and ensuring high availability throughout the release process.

## üöÄ Strategic Approaches

### Release Methodologies
1. **Traditional Deployment**
   - Full deployment
   - Scheduled releases
   - Maintenance windows
   - Batch updates

2. **Progressive Deployment**
   - Incremental deployment
   - Feature-based deployment
   - User-segmented deployment
   - Metric-driven expansion

### Risk Management
1. **Risk Assessment**
   - Impact analysis
   - Change scope evaluation
   - Dependency mapping
   - Failure scenario planning

2. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Testing requirements
   - Validation gates
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Rollback preparedness

## üîÅ Deployment Patterns

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. **Implementation Approach**
   - Environment preparation
   - Resource allocation
   - Configuration management
   - State synchronization

2. **Transition Process**
   - Traffic switching
   - Verification procedures
   - Stabilization period
   - Rollback mechanism

### Canary Deployment
1. **Implementation Approach**
   - Subset identification
   - Traffic routing
   - Monitoring configuration
   - Expansion criteria

2. **Validation Process**

   - User segmentation
   - Tracking setup
   - Result collection

2. **Decision Process**
   - Metric comparison
   - Success criteria
   - Selection methodology
   - Implementation planning

### Rolling Deployment
1. **Implementation Approach**
   - Batch sizing
