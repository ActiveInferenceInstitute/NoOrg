# DevSecOps Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive DevSecOps framework, integrating security, compliance, infrastructure, and operations automation.

## Security Automation
### Security Pipeline
- Security scanning
- [[security_architecture|Security testing]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance checks]]
- Vulnerability management

### Security Controls
- Access management
- [[security_operations|Security monitoring]]
- Threat detection
- Incident response

### Security Testing
- Security tests
- [[security_compliance|Compliance tests]]
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning

### Security Analytics
- Security metrics
- [[security_operations|Risk analytics]]
- Threat intelligence
- Performance analysis

## Compliance Automation
### Compliance Pipeline

- [[security_compliance|Compliance Framework]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
