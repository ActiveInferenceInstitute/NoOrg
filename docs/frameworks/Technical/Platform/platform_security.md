# Platform Security Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive platform security framework, focusing on security architecture, controls, and operations.

## Security Architecture
### Zero Trust Design
- Trust principles
- [[security_architecture|Security patterns]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance integration]]
- Identity foundation

### Defense in Depth
- Layer security
- [[security_operations|Security controls]]
- Protection mechanisms
- Recovery systems

### Threat Modeling
- Threat assessment
- [[threat_management|Risk analysis]]
- Attack vectors
- Mitigation strategies

### Risk Management
- Risk assessment
- [[security_operations|Risk controls]]
- Impact analysis
- Treatment plans

## Security Controls
### Access Controls
- Authentication system
- [[identity_management|Authorization framework]]
- Access management
- Privilege control

### Data Protection
- Encryption framework
- [[data_security|Data controls]]
- Privacy protection
- Data governance

### Network Security
- Network controls
- [[network_security|Traffic protection]]
- Perimeter security
- Segmentation

### Application Security
- Security testing
- [[security_operations|Code security]]
- Runtime protection
- Dependency security

## Security Operations
### Monitoring System
- Security monitoring
- [[security_operations|Threat detection]]
- Incident tracking
- Performance impact

### Incident Response
- Response procedures
- [[security_operations|Incident handling]]
- Recovery process
- Communication plan

### Threat Hunting
- Threat detection
- [[threat_management|Intelligence analysis]]
- Pattern recognition
- Investigation process

### Vulnerability Management
- Vulnerability scanning
- [[security_operations|Risk assessment]]
- Patch management
- Remediation tracking

## Integration Points
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure Framework]]
- [[security_architecture|Security Architecture]]
- [[security_operations|Security Operations]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance Framework]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
- Regular security review
- Performance optimization
- Security updates
- Compliance maintenance
