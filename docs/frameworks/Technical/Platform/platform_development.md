# Platform Development Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive platform development framework, focusing on development standards, operations, and security.

## Development Framework
### Development Standards

- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure standards]]
- [[security_compliance|Security standards]]
- Quality standards

### Code Quality
- Quality metrics
- [[security_operations|Code review]]
- Static analysis
- Performance analysis

### Testing Framework
- Test architecture
- [[security_compliance|Security testing]]
- Performance testing
- Integration testing

### Documentation System
- Documentation standards
- [[security_operations|Process documentation]]
- API documentation
- System documentation

## Development Operations
### Build Automation
- Build system
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure automation]]
- [[security_compliance|Security validation]]
- Quality checks

### Test Automation
- Test execution
- [[security_operations|Test automation]]
- Coverage analysis
- Performance testing

### Deployment Automation
- Deployment system
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure deployment]]

- [[security_operations|Security Operations]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance Framework]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
