# Prescriptive Analytics Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive prescriptive analytics framework, focusing on optimization modeling, decision support, action automation, and performance tracking.

## Optimization Modeling
### Model Architecture
- Model design
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure setup]]
- [[security_compliance|Security controls]]
- Performance optimization

### Constraint Management
- Constraint definition
- [[data_security|Validation rules]]
- Constraint tracking
- Performance impact

### Solution Space
- Space definition
- [[security_operations|Search methods]]
- Boundary conditions
- Solution validation

### Performance Analysis
- Analysis metrics
- [[security_operations|Performance tracking]]
- Quality measures
- Optimization analysis

## Decision Support
### Decision Framework
- Framework design
- [[security_operations|Process flow]]

## Integration Points
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure Framework]]
- [[security_architecture|Security Architecture]]
- [[security_operations|Security Operations]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance Framework]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
- Regular framework review
- Performance optimization
- Security updates
- Compliance maintenance
