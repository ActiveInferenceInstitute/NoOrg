# Real-time Analytics Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive real-time analytics framework, focusing on stream processing, event analysis, pattern detection, and alert generation.

## Stream Processing

- [[security_operations|Security Operations]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance Framework]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
