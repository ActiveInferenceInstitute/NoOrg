# Data Operations Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive data operations framework, focusing on data collection, processing, quality, and governance.

## Data Collection
### Collection Framework
- Collection design
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure setup]]
- [[security_compliance|Security controls]]
- Performance optimization

### Source Management
- Source integration
- [[data_security|Data validation]]
- Quality checks
- Performance monitoring

### Collection Process
- Process flow
- [[security_operations|Control points]]
- State tracking
- Error handling

### Collection Analytics
- Collection metrics
- [[security_operations|Performance tracking]]
- Quality measures
- Optimization analysis

## Data Processing
### Processing Framework
- Framework design
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure setup]]
- [[security_compliance|Security controls]]

## Integration Points
- [[technical_infrastructure_framework|Infrastructure Framework]]
- [[security_architecture|Security Architecture]]
- [[security_operations|Security Operations]]
- [[security_compliance|Compliance Framework]]

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow [[security_architecture|security architecture]] principles
2. Implement [[security_compliance|compliance requirements]]
3. Maintain [[data_security|data security]] standards
4. Ensure [[network_security|network security]] measures

## Maintenance and Updates
