# Knowledge Management Systems Documentation

This section details systems and strategies for managing knowledge within the AI agents and the broader system, including memory, retrieval augmentation, and knowledge representation.

## Overview

*   [[knowledge/agent-memory-systems|Agent Memory Systems]]: How agents store and retrieve information persistently.
*   [[knowledge/knowledge-graph-integration|Knowledge Graph Integration]]: Using structured knowledge graphs.
*   [[knowledge/retrieval-augmentation|Retrieval Augmentation (RAG)]]: Patterns for augmenting LLM prompts with retrieved knowledge.
*   [[knowledge/vector-database-setup|Vector Database Setup]]: Configuration and usage of vector databases for embeddings.

## Key Concepts

*   **Memory:** Short-term and long-term memory mechanisms for agents.
*   **Retrieval:** Techniques for finding relevant information (semantic search, graph traversal).
*   **Storage:** Databases and systems used for storing knowledge (vector DBs, graph DBs, relational DBs).
*   **Representation:** How knowledge is structured (embeddings, ontologies, graphs).
