# AGI Safety Protocols

## 📋 Overview
This document defines the safety protocols and control mechanisms for integrating AGI systems within our Operations Knowledge Base, ensuring responsible and secure deployment.

## 🛡 Control Mechanisms

### Access Controls
1. **Permission Layers**
   - Read-only access
   - Limited write access
   - Restricted tool access
   - Emergency shutdown

2. **Resource Limits**
   - Compute boundaries
   - Memory allocation
   - API rate limits
   - Storage quotas

3. **Action Boundaries**
   - Allowed operations
   - Prohibited actions
   - Required approvals
   - Validation gates

4. **Time Constraints**
   - Operation timeouts
   - Session limits
   - Cool-down periods
   - Maintenance windows

## 🎯 Alignment Methods

### Value Alignment
- Ethical principles
- Organizational values
- Safety priorities
- User protection

### Goal Structure

    B --> E[Prevent Harm]
    C --> F[Enhance Knowledge]
    D --> G[Maintain Stability]
```

### Behavioral Constraints
1. Explicit permissions
2. Conservative actions
3. Transparent operations
4. Verifiable results

### Learning Boundaries
- Controlled adaptation
- Supervised learning
- Limited self-modification
- Version control

## 🔒 Containment Strategies

### Operational Containment
1. **Sandbox Environment**
   - Isolated execution
   - Resource monitoring
   - Access control
   - State tracking

2. **Action Pipeline**
   - Proposal stage
   - Review phase
   - Approval gate
   - Execution monitoring

3. **Rollback Capability**
   - State preservation
   - Version control
   - Recovery points
   - Audit trails

### Safety Measures

#### Prevention
- Input validation
- Action verification
- Resource checking
- Pattern detection

#### Detection
