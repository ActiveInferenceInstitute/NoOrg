# Security Incident Response

## üìã Overview
This document outlines the security incident response framework and procedures for our Operations Knowledge Base, ensuring effective detection, response, and recovery from security incidents and breaches.

## üéØ Response Framework

    A --> D[Containment]
    A --> E[Recovery]
```

### Response Architecture
1. **Response Layers**
   ```yaml
   response_layers:
     detection:
       - incident_detection
       - alert_monitoring
       - threat_identification
       - impact_assessment
     response:
       - initial_response
       - incident_containment
       - threat_elimination
       - system_recovery
   ```

2. **Response Types**
   - Security breaches
   - System compromises
   - Data incidents
   - Network incidents

## üö® Incident Detection

### Detection Methods
1. **Monitoring Systems**
   ```python
   def detect_incidents():
       monitor_security_alerts()
       analyze_system_logs()
       check_network_traffic()
       verify_user_activities()
   ```

2. **Alert Processing**
   - Alert validation
   - Incident classification
   - Priority assessment
   - Initial triage

### Initial Assessment
1. **Assessment Process**
   ```json
   {
     "incident_assessment": {
       "impact": ["system_impact", "data_impact", "user_impact", "business_impact"],
       "severity": ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"],
       "scope": ["affected_systems", "affected_users", "affected_data"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - System impact
   - Data impact
   - User impact
   - Business impact

## üîç Incident Analysis
