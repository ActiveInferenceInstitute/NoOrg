# MultiAgent System

## Concept of Operations: Modular AI Agent Teams

### Overview

The MultiAgent System is a framework for composing and orchestrating specialized AI agent teams that leverage organizational units to execute complex, adaptive plans. Using the Model Context Protocol and LLM calls, these agents work collaboratively to achieve goals ranging from research and knowledge development to creating artifacts and implementing solutions.

```

### Key Components

1. **MultiAgent Coordinator**: Orchestrates interactions between agents through shared state management, task allocation, and communication.

2. **Agent Registry**: Maintains a collection of available agents with their capabilities, statuses, and metadata.

3. **Task Manager**: Handles task creation, assignment, execution, and monitoring.

4. **Shared State Manager**: Provides a centralized repository for shared knowledge and state.

5. **Organizational Units**: Modular, specialized components that agents can utilize to address domain-specific requirements (e.g., Research, Finance, Development).

## Usage Flow

1. **Request Formation**: User provides a high-level goal describing the desired outcome and organizational units needed.

2. **Team Composition**: System analyzes the request and composes an optimal team by:
   - Identifying required capabilities
   - Selecting appropriate agents
   - Allocating organizational units
   - Establishing coordination patterns

3. **Planning Phase**: The agent team develops a comprehensive plan, including:
   - Knowledge acquisition needs
   - Task breakdown and dependencies
   - Resource allocation
   - Timeline and milestones

4. **Execution Phase**: Agents work collaboratively to:
   - Research and gather information
   - Generate content and artifacts
   - Develop solutions
   - Continuously communicate and adapt the plan

5. **Knowledge Development**: Agents build a shared knowledge space for:
   - Storing research findings
   - Documenting decisions
   - Creating artifacts
   - Maintaining context

## Implementation Details

### Agent Types and Capabilities

Agents are specialized by capabilities:
- **Research Agents**: Web search, information gathering, knowledge extraction
- **Creative Writing Agents**: Document generation, content creation
- **Development Agents**: Code generation, system design, testing
- **Analytics Agents**: Data analysis, insight generation, visualization

Each agent type has a set of core capabilities as defined in the system:

```typescript
export type Capability = 
  | 'text-generation'
  | 'code-generation'
  | 'reasoning'
  | 'planning'
  | 'research'
  | 'data-analysis'
  | 'math'
  | 'web-search'
  | 'creativity'
  | 'problem-solving'
  | 'summarization'
  | 'extraction'
  | 'classification'
  | 'translation'
  | string; // Allow custom capabilities 
```

### Task Execution Model

Tasks are organized in hierarchical flows:
- High-level goals decomposed into subtasks
- Dependencies managed automatically
- Priority-based scheduling
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring

The system defines tasks with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'assigned' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
  deadline?: number;
  assignedTo?: string;
  dependsOn?: string[];
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  result?: TaskResult;
}
```

### Coordination Strategies

Available coordination patterns:
- **Centralized**: Single coordinator manages all task assignments
- **Decentralized**: Agents negotiate tasks directly
- **Hybrid**: Domain-specific coordinators with cross-domain collaboration

## Example Use Case

For "Spin up a research unit and accounting unit for a startup developing ceramic materials":

1. **Team Composition**:
   - Research agents with materials science knowledge
   - Financial analysis agents
   - Business planning agents
   - Document generation agents

2. **Knowledge Development**:
   - Research ceramic materials market, technologies, and trends
   - Analyze startup costs, revenue models, and financial projections
   - Document manufacturing processes and equipment needs
   - Create competitive landscape analysis

3. **Artifact Generation**:
   - Business plan
   - Market analysis report
   - Financial projections
   - Research roadmap
   - Technical specifications

## Integration with Organizational Knowledge

The system integrates with organizational documentation structure:
- Utilizes existing knowledge from docs/ directory
- Follows established templates and standards
- Produces artifacts compatible with the existing information architecture
- Updates relevant documentation with new findings

## Scalability and Extensions

The framework supports:
- Dynamic addition of new agent types
- Integration of custom organizational units
- Extension through specialized capabilities
- Adaptation to different domains and requirements

## Security and Governance

Built-in governance mechanisms:
- Access control for sensitive information
- Audit trails for agent actions
- Policy enforcement for operational guidelines
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented with the following core components:

1. **MultiAgentCoordinator**: Manages the lifecycle of agent teams and tasks
   ```typescript
   class MultiAgentCoordinator {
     private agentRegistry: AgentRegistry;
     private sharedStateManager: SharedStateManager;
     private taskManager: TaskManager;
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **AgentRegistry**: Tracks available agents and their capabilities
   ```typescript
   class AgentRegistry {
     registerAgent(agent: Agent): boolean;
     getAgent(id: string): Agent | null;
     listAgents(filter?: AgentFilter): Agent[];
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. **TaskManager**: Handles task creation, assignment, and tracking
   ```typescript
   class TaskManager {
     createTask(task: Partial<Task>): string;
     assignTask(taskId: string, agentId: string): boolean;
     updateTaskStatus(taskId: string, status: Task['status']): boolean;
     // ...
   }
   ```

4. **SharedStateManager**: Provides shared memory and state for agent collaboration
   ```typescript
   class SharedStateManager {
     setState(key: string, value: any): void;
     getState(key: string): any;
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Getting Started

To create a new multi-agent system for a specific use case:

1. Define the required organizational units:
   ```typescript
   import { MultiAgentCoordinator } from '../src/core/multiagent/MultiAgentCoordinator';
   
   const coordinator = new MultiAgentCoordinator('CeramicStartupTeam', {
     coordinationStrategy: 'hybrid',
     executionConfig: {
       maxConcurrentTasks: 8,
       useAgentSpecialization: true
     }
   });
   ```

2. Register required agents:
   ```typescript
   await coordinator.registerAgent({
     name: 'MaterialsResearchAgent',
     type: 'research',
     capabilities: ['research', 'web-search', 'summarization'],
     status: 'available'
   });
   
   await coordinator.registerAgent({
     name: 'FinancialAnalysisAgent',
     type: 'analytics',
     capabilities: ['data-analysis', 'math', 'planning'],
     status: 'available'
   });
   ```

3. Create the high-level goal task:
   ```typescript
   const mainTaskId = await coordinator.createTask({
     title: 'Ceramic Materials Startup Development',
     description: 'Research and plan for a startup developing ceramic materials',
     priority: 'high'
   });
   ```

4. Start the coordination process:
   ```typescript
   await coordinator.start();
   ```

## Future Directions

The multiagent system is under active development with planned features including:

- Enhanced team formation algorithms using agent performance history
- Support for long-term agent memory across sessions
- Improved reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought techniques
- Dynamic resource allocation based on task priority and complexity
- Integration with external knowledge sources and APIs
