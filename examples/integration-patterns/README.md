# Integration Pattern Examples

Demonstrations of the resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry, timeout, bulkhead, rate limiter, request-response). Each script should be runnable with `ts-node` and clearly show input, expected behavior, and observable outputs.

- Keep dependencies minimal; reuse shared utility functions where possible.
- Document prerequisites (API keys, env vars) at the top of each example.
- Prefer deterministic scenarios so they can run in CI.
