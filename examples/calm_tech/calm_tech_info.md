Calm Technology is a process for designing technology that works with human attention, instead of against it.

Smarter Humans, Not Devices
Launched in May 2024, Calm Tech Institute is dedicated to redefining human-technology interaction by promoting design principles that enhance human life without causing stress or distraction.

Calm Tech Institute offers: 
Calm Tech Certified™: A certification process that evaluates products against calm technology principles, aiming to complete assessments within two weeks. 

Workshops and Training: Interactive sessions designed to educate teams on the principles of calm technology and their application in product design. 
History

While writing her thesis on smartphones in 2007, designer and researcher Amber Case first encountered a small set of Xerox PARC papers from the 1990s describing Calm Tech. Starting in 2010, she expanded on these essays by creating Principles of Calm Technology, further extending them with her influential 2015 book Calm Technology: Principles and Patterns for Non-Intrusive Design.

​

The concept of Calm Technology and Case's principles for Calm Product Design have since been adopted by companies all over the world, including Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Virgin Global and AirBNB. Calm Technology also inspired award-winning product designs by Kyoto-based startup mui Lab.
 

Principles of Calm Technology™

I. Technology should require the smallest possible amount of attention

II. Technology should inform and create calm

III. Technology should make use of the periphery

IV. Technology should amplify the best of technology and the best of humanity

V. Technology can communicate, but doesn’t need to speak

VI. Technology should work even when it fails

VII. The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve the problem

VIII. Leverage familiar behaviors to introduce new ones

Announcing Calm Tech Certified™ and the First Class of Certified Products

Today we're excited to announce the launch of Calm Tech Certified™, a certification program designed to help companies create products that prioritize customer well-being by reducing their stress and cognitive load. Calm Tech Certified™ is the world's first standard for attention and technology. 


To help inaugurate the Calm Tech Certification Process, we’ve awarded Certification to a select number of existing products which satisfy the 81 point Calm Tech Certification Standard. 






Calm Tech Certified™ Awardees 

Airthings™ View Plus


Airthings™ View Plus: Air quality inside the home affects human health, but is often invisible. Airthings makes air quality visible through seven sensors and visualizes them in a calm way. Airthings devices have e-ink displays and colored indicators, compressing information into a glanceable display, while allowing for a detailed view through the app. The battery life is extremely long, the unit is small and responsible, and it passes Calm Tech Certification on every level. 


Noteworthy features include comprehensive monitoring (seven air quality sensors provide a holistic view of indoor environments) and a companion app showing historic data.  


Calm Tech Principles in Airthings’ Design: 

Use of the periphery: Airthings works in the background by monitoring air quality without being the center of attention.


Communicate without speaking: The visual indicator light and E-Ink display provides visual cues about air quality without intrusive audible alerts.



Daylight Computer (DC-1) 



Daylight Computer: The World’s First 60 Hz E-Paper computer, the Daylight DC1 is a laptop designed to be used both outdoors and at night without disrupting circadian rhythm, the Daylight Computer (DC-1) represents a paradigm shift in computing devices, earning it Calm Tech Certification. This innovative device combines the benefits of digital technology with a more human-friendly interface. 


Calm Tech Principles in Daylight Computer: 

Paper-like display: The world's first full-speed (60fps) paper-like display reduces eye strain and allows for comfortable use in various lighting conditions.

Distraction-free environment: By offering a dedicated space for focused tasks like reading, writing, and note-taking, DC-1 minimizes digital distractions.

Extended battery life: Days of use on a single charge reduce the anxiety associated with frequent charging needs. 

Night shift: The use of a warm, amber color allows for continued use without interrupting sleep. 



Time Timer® MOD Home Edition


Time Timer: A visual timer that makes time easy. Popular for teachers, and parents of kids with autism and ADHD, Time Timer features a colored disc that gradually disappears as time elapses, providing an intuitive visual representation of chronology. It's often used for productivity, time management, and helping children understand the concept of time. 


Calm Tech Principles in Time Timer® MOD Home Edition: 

Requires minimal attention: Time Timer uses a visual representation of time passing, allowing users to grasp remaining time at a glance without needing to actively focus on it.

Informs and creates calm: The gradual disappearance of the colored disk provides a calm, intuitive way to show time elapsing, potentially reducing anxiety associated with time pressure.

Uses the periphery: Time Timer can be placed in the user's peripheral vision, allowing them to stay aware of time without it dominating their attention.




Unpluq Tag + Premium Subscription 



Unpluq: A simple keychain tag with NFC connectivity, Unplug “locks” selected apps for a designated time, preventing access unless they’re physically unlocked – giving users a concrete, customizable means to manage their digital habits, while aligning with calm technology's emphasis on tangible interfaces. 


Calm Tech Principles in Unplug: 

Requires minimal attention: Unpluq uses a physical key to manage phone access, requiring minimal cognitive effort to engage or disengage from digital distractions.


Informs and creates calm: Unpluq reduces anxiety and creates a sense of calm by restricting access to distracting and stressful apps.


With over 50% of users still engaged after a year, and an average screen time reduction of 1 hour and 22 minutes per day, Unpluq demonstrates lasting behavioral change. CTI recently spoke with Unplug CEO Caroline Cadwell for this in-depth interview.


We’re always excited to come across products like these which already use / align with Calm Tech principles. We hope this first batch of certified products helps people understand the broad range of applications of Calm Tech Principles and inspires more companies to build with principles of Calm Technology. 


Calm Tech Certification gives brands a competitive edge by ensuring their products are designed to minimize distractions, enhance engagement, and foster lasting customer loyalty. Built around a thorough audit of a product and rigorous certification evaluation, Calm Tech Certified™ products meet the highest standards of calm and thoughtful design.
