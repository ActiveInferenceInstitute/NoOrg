  "input": "Design an organization literally shaped like a lollipop. It should feature a 'stick' composed of several vertically nested hierarchical layers for core production and support functions (e.g., supply chain, HR, finance). The 'candy' top layer should be a hub-and-spoke structure with a central coordination unit connected to 6 distinct operational spokes responsible for different aspects of lollipop creation (e.g., flavor R&D, candy making, stick production, wrapping & packaging, quality assurance, marketing & sales)."
