SITUATION ASSESSMENT:
{
  "situation_analysis": "Currently, there is a lack of accessible tools for monitoring ant behavior globally on a large scale, both above and below ground. This absence of information is making it difficult for citizens, local government officials, and community organizations to gain insight into ant activities, which can have significant ecological implications. Current methods may be manual, time-consuming, and require technical expertise, making it restrictive and not user-friendly for people of all ages and abilities. Moreover, there is a lack of privacy-preserving architecture in existing solutions, which raises concerns about data security.",
