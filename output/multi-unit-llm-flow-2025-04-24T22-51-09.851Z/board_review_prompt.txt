      "insight": "Ease of use is a key factor for all user groups, and privacy is a particular concern for institutional users.",
      "source": "User testing and interviews"
    }
  ],
  "barriers_opportunities": {
    "barriers": [
      "The technical complexity of monitoring ant behavior on a global scale",
      "The need for robust data privacy measures",
      "Potential competition from established environmental monitoring companies"
    ],
    "opportunities": [
      "The growing interest in citizen science and environmental conservation",
      "The lack of existing solutions specifically tailored for monitoring ant behavior",
      "The potential to leverage AI and cloud technology for innovative solutions"
    ]
  },
  "viability_assessment": {
    "viability": "The proposed concept of AntScope has a promising market given the size and growth potential of the environmental monitoring market. It meets a unique need, and current competitors do not offer an equivalent product. However, its success will depend on the ability to overcome significant technical and privacy-related challenges."
