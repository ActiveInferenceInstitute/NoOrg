## Final Deliverable
### Executive Summary
The project aims to develop and launch a machine that counts ant behavior, providing a tool for citizens, local government officials, and community organizations to better understand the ant activity both above and below ground in their local environment. The design approach is human-centered, mobile-first, and privacy-preserving. The project will be completed in phases, with budget estimates and timelines defined for each phase.

### Project Vision
To create a user-friendly, accessible, and technologically advanced machine that accurately counts ant behavior, contributing to environmental research and community awareness.

### Solution Overview
The solution is a machine that utilizes advanced sensors and data collection techniques to count ant behavior. The data is then transmitted to a mobile application, which is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all technical abilities.
