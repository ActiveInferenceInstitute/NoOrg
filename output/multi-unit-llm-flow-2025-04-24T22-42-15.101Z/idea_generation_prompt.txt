SITUATION ASSESSMENT:
{
  "situation_analysis": "The current situation reveals a low level of citizen participation in local decision-making processes and a perceived lack of transparency in government operations. This could be due to several factors including lack of an easy-to-use platform for communication, limited accessibility for various age groups and tech abilities, and concerns over privacy. The mobile-first approach, while promising, needs to be considered in light of the wide-ranging technical abilities of the target user base. Further, the absence of a human-centered design in existing solutions may be leading to low user engagement.",
