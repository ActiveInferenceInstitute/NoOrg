PROJECT BRIEF:
Functionality: An AI-powered community engagement platform for local government
Situation to address: Low citizen participation in local decision-making processes and limited government transparency
Approach: Human-centered design with accessibility features, mobile-first approach, and privacy-preserving architecture
Target users: Citizens of all ages and technical abilities, local government officials, and community organizations
