## Relationship Types
- **hierarchy**: 5 relationships
- **peer**: 2 relationships
- **service_provider**: 3 relationships
- **custom**: 4 relationships
- **advisor**: 1 relationships

## Key Demonstrated Features
1. Creating organizational units with different types
2. Establishing hierarchical, peer, and support relationships
3. Managing permissions between units
4. Dynamic modification of relationships

## Organizational Structure

### Hierarchical Structure
```
Executive Committee
├── Research Division
│   ├── AI Team
│   └── Data Science Team
└── Development Division
    └── Platform Team
```

### Support Relationships
Security Office provides services to:
- Research Division
- Development Division

Infrastructure Team provides services to:
- AI Team
- Platform Team

### Project Relationships
Project Alpha involves:
- AI Team
- Platform Team
- Security Office
- Data Science Team

## Permission Model
The example demonstrates a granular permission model with:
- Resource-specific permissions
- Multiple permission levels (READ, WRITE, ADMIN)
- Time-based access controls
- Conditional access rules

## Next Steps
- Implement role-based access control
- Add permission inheritance along hierarchical lines
- Create relationship visualization tools
