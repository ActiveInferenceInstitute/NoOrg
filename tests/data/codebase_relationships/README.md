# Codebase Relationship Analysis

This directory contains files documenting the relationships between different parts of the codebase.
These files are generated by the codebase relationship analysis tests to facilitate
LLM/Agent-enabled code development.

## Files

- `python_dependencies.json`: Python import dependencies
- `typescript_dependencies.json`: TypeScript import dependencies
- `markdown_links.json`: Links between markdown documentation files
- `python_module_dependencies.json`: High-level dependencies between Python modules
- `documentation_graph.json`: Graph of document relationships
- `dependency_metrics.json`: Metrics about codebase dependencies
- `dependency_metrics.md`: Human-readable report of dependency metrics

## Usage

This documentation is intended to be used by LLM/Agent-enabled development tools
to gain a better understanding of the relationships and dependencies within the codebase.

The JSON files can be programmatically loaded and used by tools, while the Markdown
files provide human-readable documentation.

## Regeneration

To regenerate these files, run:

```bash
python tests/run_structure_analysis.py
```
