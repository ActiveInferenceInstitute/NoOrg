# Codebase Analysis Data

This directory contains data files generated by automated analysis of the repository structure and codebase relationships. These files are designed to help facilitate LLM/Agent-enabled code development by providing structured information about the codebase.

## Directory Structure

- `repo_structure/`: Files documenting the repository structure
- `codebase_relationships/`: Files documenting relationships between codebase components

## Usage for LLM/Agent Development

The data files in these directories provide LLMs and AI agents with structured information about the codebase, which helps them:

1. **Understand Repository Organization**: Get a clear picture of the directory and file structure
2. **Analyze Dependencies**: Understand how different parts of the codebase relate to each other
3. **Identify Patterns**: Recognize consistent patterns in the codebase
4. **Generate Context-Aware Code**: Write code that fits the existing patterns and organization
5. **Improve Navigation**: Quickly locate relevant files and directories
6. **Enhance Documentation**: Generate accurate documentation based on code structure

## File Formats

The data is provided in two formats:

- **JSON**: Machine-readable format for programmatic use
- **Markdown**: Human-readable format for documentation

## Regenerating the Data

To regenerate all analysis data:

```bash
python tests/run_structure_analysis.py
```

For more options:

```bash
python tests/run_structure_analysis.py --help
```

## Integration with LLM Tools

These data files can be integrated with LLM/Agent tools in several ways:

1. **Direct Loading**: Load JSON files directly into LLM context
2. **Context Building**: Use the data to build better prompts and context
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Understand dependencies to predict impact of changes
4. **Code Generation**: Use structure patterns to generate new code that matches existing styles
