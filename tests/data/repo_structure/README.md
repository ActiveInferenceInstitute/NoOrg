# Repository Structure Analysis

This directory contains files documenting the structure of the repository.
These files are generated by the repository structure analysis tests to facilitate
LLM/Agent-enabled code development.

## Files

- `repository_structure.json`: Complete repository structure in JSON format
- `repository_structure.md`: Human-readable repository structure
- `{component}_structure.json`: Structure of specific components in JSON format
- `{component}_structure.md`: Human-readable structure of specific components
- `file_extensions.json`: Count of file extensions in the repository
- `file_extensions.md`: Human-readable report of file extensions

## Usage

This documentation is intended to be used by LLM/Agent-enabled development tools
to gain a better understanding of the repository structure and organization.

The JSON files can be programmatically loaded and used by tools, while the Markdown
files provide human-readable documentation.

## Regeneration

To regenerate these files, run:

```bash
python tests/run_structure_analysis.py
