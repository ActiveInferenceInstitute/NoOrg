- ts-node

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies for running the tests.

# Multiagent System Testing Framework

This directory contains the testing framework and test cases for the multiagent coordination system. The testing framework is designed to make it easy to test both individual components and the interactions between components in a multiagent system.

## Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── data/               # Test data and mock responses
├── integration/        # Integration tests for multiple components
├── reports/            # Test reports and coverage data
├── system/             # End-to-end system tests
├── unit/               # Unit tests for individual components
└── utils/              # Test helpers and utilities
```

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run specific test suites:

```bash
# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run system tests only
npm run test:system
```

## Test Helpers

The `test-helpers.ts` file in the `utils` directory provides a set of utilities to simplify testing:

- `createTestFixture()`: Creates isolated instances of core components for testing
- `createMockLLMClient()`: Creates a mock LLM client that returns predefined responses
- `createTestAgent()`: Creates a test agent with the specified type and capabilities
- `createTestTask()`: Creates a test task with the specified type and description
- `setupTestScenario()`: Sets up a complete test scenario with agents, tasks, and state
- `runWorkflowTest()`: Runs a complete workflow test based on a scenario
- `validateWorkflowResults()`: Validates the results of a workflow test
- `CompositeAgentTesting`: Utilities for testing agent compositions

## Test Data

The test data directory contains:

- Mock LLM responses for various prompts
- Sample inputs for different test scenarios
- Expected outputs for validation

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. They typically follow this pattern:

1. Create a test fixture or mock dependencies
2. Initialize the component under test
3. Perform operations on the component
4. Verify the results match expectations

Example:

```typescript
it('should update agent status', async () => {
  const registry = new AgentRegistry();
  const agent = createTestAgent('test', ['capability1']);
  await registry.registerAgent(agent);
  await registry.updateAgentStatus(agent.id, 'busy');
  const updatedAgent = await registry.getAgent(agent.id);
  expect(updatedAgent.status).to.equal('busy');
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly:

1. Create a test fixture with real (not mocked) components
2. Initialize the components and establish connections
3. Perform operations that span multiple components
4. Verify the components interact correctly

Example:

```typescript
it('should coordinate agent assignment for a task', async () => {
  const fixture = createTestFixture();
  await fixture.coordinator.initialize();
  
  const agent = createTestAgent('worker', ['processing']);
  await fixture.coordinator.registerAgent(agent);
  
  const taskId = await fixture.taskManager.createTask({
    type: 'process',
    description: 'Process data',
    metadata: { requiredCapabilities: ['processing'] }
  });
  
  await fixture.coordinator.start();
  // Wait for coordinator to process
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  
  const task = await fixture.taskManager.getTask(taskId);
  expect(task.assignedTo).to.equal(agent.id);
  expect(task.status).to.equal('assigned');
  
  await fixture.coordinator.stop();
});
```

### System Testing

System tests verify the entire system's behavior:

1. Set up a complete system with all components
2. Define a realistic workflow scenario
3. Execute the workflow
4. Verify the system produces the expected results

Example:

```typescript
it('should execute a multi-agent workflow', async () => {
  const scenario = {
    name: 'Research and Analysis',
    description: 'Research a topic and analyze the findings',
    agents: [
      createTestAgent('research', ['research']),
      createTestAgent('analysis', ['analysis'])
    ],
    tasks: [
      createTestTask('research', 'Research AI coordination'),
      createTestTask('analysis', 'Analyze research findings')
    ],
    mockLLMResponses: {
      // Mock responses for LLM calls
    }
  };
  
  const result = await runWorkflowTest(scenario);
  validateWorkflowResults(result, {
    // Expected results
  });
});
```

## Testing Agent Composability

The framework includes utilities specifically for testing agent compositions - multiple agents working together on complex tasks:

```typescript
it('should test agent collaboration', async () => {
  const result = await CompositeAgentTesting.testAgentCollaboration(
    [
      createTestAgent('research', ['research']),
      createTestAgent('analysis', ['analysis'])
    ],
    createTestTask('composite', 'Research and analyze data', {
      metadata: { requiredCapabilities: ['research', 'analysis'] }
    }),
    {
      // Mock LLM responses
    }
  );
  
  expect(result.task.status).to.equal('completed');
  // Verify other aspects of the collaboration
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolate tests**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.
2. **Mock external dependencies**: Use the mock LLM client for tests that would otherwise call the OpenAI API.
3. **Use descriptive test names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested and the expected outcome.
4. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for error conditions, empty inputs, and boundary conditions.
5. **Keep tests focused**: Each test should verify a single aspect of the system's behavior.
6. **Clean up after tests**: Use the `afterEach` or `after` hooks to clean up resources created during tests.

## Adding New Tests

To add a new test:

1. Determine the appropriate test category (unit, integration, or system)
2. Create a new test file in the corresponding directory
3. Import the necessary test helpers and components
4. Write your test cases using the patterns demonstrated in existing tests
5. Run the tests to verify they work as expected

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline. The results and coverage reports are available in the CI dashboard.

## Examples

See the existing test files for examples of how to write different types of tests:

- `unit/agent-registry.test.ts`: Unit tests for the AgentRegistry component
- `integration/agent-coordination.test.ts`: Integration tests for agent coordination
- `system/multiagent-workflow.test.ts`: Complete system tests for multiagent workflows

# Test Framework for Multiagent Operations

This directory contains the test framework for the multiagent operations system, designed to support organizational-scale multiagent compositions and deployments.

## Directory Structure

```

├── unit/               # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/        # Integration tests between components
├── system/             # End-to-end system tests
│   └── multiagent/     # Multiagent system-level tests
├── utils/              # Test utilities and helpers

    ├── run_js.js       # JavaScript/TypeScript test runner
    └── run_py.py       # Python test runner
```

## Testing Philosophy

This test framework follows these principles:

1. **Real vs. Mock Testing**: Tests can run with either real LLM integration or mock responses
2. **Modular Testing**: Tests are organized to match the modular architecture of the codebase
3. **Organizational Alignment**: Tests validate that agents can be composed according to organizational units
4. **Performance Tracking**: Token usage, response times, and memory usage are tracked and reported

## Running Tests

### JavaScript/TypeScript Tests

```bash
# Run all JavaScript/TypeScript tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:system

# Run with real LLM integration
npm run test -- --use-real-llm

# Run a specific test file
npm run test-file -- path/to/test/file.ts
```

### Python Tests

```bash
# Run all Python tests
python tests/runners/run_py.py

# Run specific test types
python tests/runners/run_py.py --test-type unit
python tests/runners/run_py.py --test-type integration
python tests/runners/run_py.py --test-type system

# Run with coverage reporting
python tests/runners/run_py.py --coverage
```

## Test Utilities

The `utils/test-helpers.ts` file provides essential utilities for testing multiagent systems:

- `createTestFixture()`: Creates isolated test instances of core components
- `createRealLLMClient()`: Creates a configured OpenAI client for real API testing
- `createTestAgent()`: Creates test agent instances with specified capabilities
- `setupTestScenario()`: Sets up complete test scenarios with agents, tasks, and state
- `runWorkflowTest()`: Executes and validates a complete workflow test

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with necessary configuration:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
MAX_TOKENS=2000
TEMPERATURE=0.7
MAX_MONTHLY_SPEND=50
ALERT_THRESHOLD=0.8
```

## Testing Organizational Compositions

Tests under the `system/multiagent` directory specifically validate organizational multiagent compositions, ensuring that agents can be effectively composed according to the organization units defined in the `units/` directory.

The `test_real_llm_workflow.ts` file demonstrates a complete end-to-end test of a multiagent workflow with real LLM integration.

## Token Usage Tracking

All tests with real LLM integration include token usage tracking to monitor API costs. Usage statistics are logged to the console and stored in `reports/` for analysis.

## Best Practices

1. Always include clear expectations and assertions in tests
2. Use fixtures to avoid duplicating setup code
3. Mock external services when testing non-LLM functionality
4. Follow the same modular structure as the main codebase
5. Include tests for error handling and edge cases
