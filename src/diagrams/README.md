# Diagram Utilities

This directory contains utilities for generating diagrams and visualizations of the multi-agent system architecture and workflows. These tools help visualize complex relationships and processes within the system.

## Available Utilities

### Mermaid Utilities (mermaidUtils.js)

A set of utilities for generating [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) diagrams that visualize agent relationships, workflows, and system architecture.

```javascript
const { generateAgentDiagram, generateWorkflowDiagram } = require('./mermaidUtils');

// Generate a diagram showing agent relationships
const agentDiagram = generateAgentDiagram(agents, relationships);
console.log(agentDiagram);

// Generate a workflow diagram
const workflowDiagram = generateWorkflowDiagram(workflowSteps);
console.log(workflowDiagram);
```text

## Diagram Types

The diagramming utilities support several types of diagrams:

### Agent Relationship Diagrams

Shows connections and relationships between agents in the system. Useful for visualizing the communication structure and dependencies between agents.

### Workflow Diagrams

Illustrates the sequence of steps in a workflow, showing the flow of tasks between agents and decision points.

### System Architecture Diagrams

Provides a high-level view of the system architecture, showing the major components and their relationships.

### Organization Structure Diagrams

Visualizes the organizational unit structure and hierarchical relationships between units.

## Usage in Documentation

Diagrams generated by these utilities can be embedded in documentation files:

# System Architecture

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of the system:

## Integration with Other Tools

The diagram utilities can be integrated with other tools:

- **Documentation Generators**: Automatically include up-to-date diagrams in generated documentation
- **Development Tools**: Visualize the current system state during development
- **Monitoring Dashboards**: Display live system structure and workflow progress

## Development Guidelines

When extending the diagramming utilities:

1. Use consistent styling and notation across different diagram types
2. Ensure generated diagrams are readable at different scales
3. Provide options for customizing diagram appearance
4. Handle large datasets gracefully (e.g., by simplifying or paginating diagrams)
5. Document new diagram types and their usage
